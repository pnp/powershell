This module is a successor of the [PnP-PowerShell](https://github.com/pnp/pnp-powershell) module. The original cmdlets only work on Windows and Windows PowerShell and supports SharePoint On-Premises (2013, 2016 and 2019) and SharePoint Online. This version of the cmdlets is cross-platform (i.e it works on Windows, MacOS and Linux) but it will only support SharePoint Online. Going forward we will only be **actively maintaining the cross-platform PnP PowerShell** module.

For more information about installing or upgrading to this module, please refer to the documentation at https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/index.html
