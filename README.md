# PnP PowerShell

**PnP PowerShell** is a .NET Core 3.1 / .NET Framework 4.6.1 based PowerShell Module providing over 600 cmdlets that work with Microsoft 365 environments such as SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Project, Security & Compliance, Azure Active Directory, and more.

This module is a successor of the [PnP-PowerShell](https://github.com/pnp/pnp-powershell) module. The original cmdlets only work on Windows and Windows PowerShell and supports SharePoint On-Premises (2013, 2016 and 2019) and SharePoint Online. This version of the cmdlets is cross-platform (i.e it works on Windows, MacOS and Linux) but it will only support SharePoint Online. Going forward we will only be **actively maintaining the cross-platform PnP PowerShell** module.

For more information about installing or upgrading to this module, please refer to the documentation at https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/index.html
