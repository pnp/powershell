### Changed

- `Update-PnPVivaConnectionsDashboardACE` is now called `Set-PnPVivaConnectionsDashboardACE` but `Update-PnPVivaConnectionsDashboardACE` will still work as an alias.
- All `Set|Get|Remove-PnPVivaConnectionsDashboardACE` cmdlets now take either the InstanceId (preferred), Title, the Id, or an actual ACE for the Identity property. If multiple ACEs of the same id or with the same title are found a warning will be shown if Id or Title is used to find the ACE.
- Made PropertiesJSON an optional parameter on `Add-PnPVivaConnectionsDashboardACE` as it is not always required when adding an ACE
- Added a 10 second timeout on the new version check on `Connect-PnPOnline` to prevent the cmdlet from hanging when the connection is slow, GitHub being blocked by a firewall or GitHub being unavailable [#2550](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/2550)
- Improved `Add-PnPField`, `Get-PnPListItem` and `Get-PnPSiteDesignRun` cmdlets by improving null checks based on warnings from compiler. [#PR1](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/commit/791b031d5fa844f1e6961b1136df9f79f19bfdcd) and [#PR2](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/commit/d56f3cd497be79170f68b29be490b222bf042aaa)
- Improved `Register-PnPAzureADApp` and `Register-PnPManagementShellAccess` cmdlets to reuse existing HTTP client instead of creating a new one. [#2682](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/2682)
- Improved `Register-PnPAzureADApp` cmdlet based on compiler warnings. [#2682](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/2682)
- `Connect-PnPOnline` will now throw a much clearer error message if the site to be connected doesn't exist when using the legacy Client Id with Secret (ACS) authentication mode. [#2707](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/2707)
- Properties of `Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipal` are now all typed instead of some of them returning unparsed JSON fragments. [#2717](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/2717)
- Changed `Add-PnPTeamsChannel` to no longer require an `-OwnerUPN` to be provided when specifying `-ChannelType Standard` [#2786](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/2786)
- Changed `Add-PnPFile` by default to upload a file as a draft with a minor version now instead of publishing it as a major version. `-CheckinType MajorCheckIn` can be used to still upload the file as a major published version [#2806](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/2806)
- Changed `Send-PnPMail` to support `-Verbose` and provide feedback if sending the e-mail has failed [#2880](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/2880)

### Removed

- Removed `Get-PnPSubscribeSharePointNewsDigest` and `Set-PnPSubscribeSharePointNewsDigest` as the implementation behind these features has been changed in SharePoint Online causing them no longer to work. At present, there's no alternative for this that we can call into thus we will have to remove these in a future version. There is a Design Change Request open with the Program Group to add back APIs for doing this. If that will be accepted and implemented, we will add these back again. [#2720](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/2720)

- The `OnlyAllowMembersViewMembership` and `SetAssociatedGroup` parameters have been removed. They were already marked as obsolete. You should use `-DisallowMembersViewMembership` parameter to disallow group members viewing membership and use `Set-PnPGroup` cmdlet to set groups as associated groups.

### Removed

- Removed `ConvertTo-PnPClientSidePage` cmdlet as it has been replaced by `ConvertTo-PnPPage`
this option is not enabled yet on your tenant in which case trying to set it results in to `Set-PnPTenant: The requested operation is part of an experimental feature that is not supported in the current environment.`. In that case try again later.

## [1.3.0]

### Added

- Added `-HideTitleInHeader` parameter to `Set-PnPWeb` to hide or show the title in the header. Use `-HideTitleInHeader` to hide it and `-HideTitleInHeader:$false` to show it.
- Added `-ShowContentUrl` parameter to `Register-PnPManagementShellAccess` retrieve the url to consent to the PnP Management Shell application by an administrator.
- Added `-IsFavoriteByDefault` parameter on Set-PnPTeamsChannel and Add-PnPTeamsChannel
- Added `-GroupIdDefined` boolean parameter to Get-PnPTenantSite to allow filtering on sites which belong to a Microsoft 365 Group
- Added `-Interactive` login option to `Connect-PnPOnline` which is similar to `-UseWebLogin` but without the limitations of the latter. The `-UseWebLogin` is using cookie based authentication towards SharePoint and cannot access Graph tokens. Using `-Interactive` we use Azure AD Authentication and as a result we are able to acquire Graph tokens.

### Changed

- Fixed certificate clean up issue on Windows platform when using `Connect-PnPOnline` with a certificate.
- Fixed issues with `Register-PnPAzureADApp` when using the various auth options (-DeviceLogin / -Interactive)
- Renamed the `-PnPManagementShell` option to `-DeviceLogin` on `Connect-PnPOnline`. `-PnPManagementShell` is still available as an alias.
- Added `-ClientId` option to `-DeviceLogin` allowing device code authentication with custom app registrations.
- Changed `-Url` parameter on Get-PnPTenantSite and Set-PnPTenantSite to `-Identity`. Made `-Url` available as an alias.
- Updated `Set-PnPTenantSite` to support same parameters as `Set-SPOSite`
- Updated `Get-PnPTenantSite` to return same properties as `Get-SPOSite`
- Fixed issue where `-Interactive` on `Connect-PnPOnline` would prompt for credentials when connecting to new site within same tenant. Added -ForceLogin parameter to force
- Get-PnPUser and any other cmdlet that takes a UserPipeBind parameter as input now allows users to be specified by name besides loginname or id.
- Fixed issue where retrieving a single site with Get-PnPTenantSite vs retrieving all sites showed different properties.
- Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod now returns usable objects
- Updated `Set-PnPListItem` to have an `UpdateType` parameter. Obsoleted `SystemUpdate`. Also updated the backend logic so can now also specify `UpdateOverwriteVersion` to update the editor, author, modified and created fields.
- `Register-PnPAzureADApp` now outputs the base64 encoded version of the certificate which can be used with `Connect-PnPOnline -ClientId -CertificateBase64Encoded`
- Fixed issue with moving and copying files to subfolder, Issue #165.
- fixed issue where Get-PnPTenantSite was not returning all properties correct, Issue #151
- Added `-Interactive` login option to Register-PnPManagementApp which allows for an interactive authentication flow not using device login for environments that require Multi-Factor Authentication.
- Updated all Microsoft365Group cmdlets to only load the SiteUrl of the underlying Microsoft 365 Group where required. This means that `Get-PnPMicrosoft365Group -Identity` will not by default load the site url. Specify `-IncludeSiteUrl` to include it.

## [0.2.*-nightly]

### Added

- Added `Convert-PnPSiteTemplateToMarkdown` to convert an existing XML based template to a markdown report. Notice that this is work in progress and the functionality will increase. See also the 'Changed' section below for information about `Get-PnPSiteTemplate` (0.3.5)
- Added `-UseWeblogin` and `-ForceAuthentication` to `Connect-PnPOnline` to allow using Multi-Factor Authentication. Notice this uses cookie based authentication, which is limited in its functionality. Using -UseWebLogin we will for instance not be able to acquire an access token for the Graph, and as a result none of the Graph related cmdlets will work. Also some of the functionality of the provisioning engine (`Get-PnPSiteTemplate`, `Get-PnPTenantTemplate`, `Invoke-PnPSiteTemplate`, `Invoke-PnPTenantTemplate`) will not work because of this reason. The cookies will in general expire within a few days and if you use `-UseWebLogin` within that time popup window will appear that will dissappear immediately, this is expected. Use `-ForceAuthentication` to reset the authentication cookies and force a new login. (0.2.25)
- Allowed to specify -ClientId when logging in with credentials so people can use their own Azure AD apps and credentials for authentication towards SharePoint Online (0.2.17)
- Added environment variable check (set `PNPPOWERSHELL_UPDATECHECK` to `Off`) to Connect-PnPOnline to skip version check if set. (0.2.15)
- Added `Get-PnPChangeLog` cmdlet which returns this changelog. (0.2.14)
- Added `-DeviceLogin` parameter to `Register-PnPAzureADApp` (renamed from Initialize-PnPPowerShellAuthentication in 0.2.15) which allows for users with MFA to setup a custom app (0.2.12)
- Added `NoVersionCheck` optional flag to `Connect-PnPOnline` [PR#28](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/28) (0.2.9)
- Added native support for Secret Management Modules (0.1.34)
- Marked -ExcludeSiteUrl as obselete on `Get-PnPMicrosoft365Group` for performance reasons. Use -IncludeSiteUrl instead.
- Added -CloudShell switch to `Connect-PnPOnline` which can be used in the Azure Cloud Shell. If specified you will automatically authenticate using the current identity you're logged in with to the Azure Cloud Shell. Notice: only Graph based cmdlets (Teams, Microsoft Groups etc.) will function. For SharePoint connectivity use one of the other connection options with `Connect-PnPOnline`.
- Added -DisableCustomAppAuthentication to `Set-PnPTenant` and added support for DisableCustomAppAuthentication in `Get-PnPTenant`.

## [0.1.*-nightly]

### Added

### Changed

- Added filename support for .md file with `Get-PnPSiteTemplate` to generate a markdown file. e.g. you can now execute for instance `Get-PnPSiteTemplate -Out .\myreport.md -Handlers Lists,ContentTypes,Features,WebSettings` to generate an markdown report of those artifacts. This is work in progress.
- Fixed issue with `-UseWebLogin` throws a 403 error when connecting to a different site collection than the root site collection.
- Removed `Enable-PnPPowerShellTelemetry` and `Disable-PnPPowerShellTelemetry`. See [Configure PnP PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell) for more information on how to enable or disable telemetry collection (0.2.22)

- Updated telemetry handling. If the environment variable `PNPPOWERSHELL_DISABLETELEMETRY` is set to `true`, no telemetry will be recorded. If the .pnppowershelltelemetry file is present in the home folder of the user then the the contents of this file will override the environment variable settings. See `Enable-PnPPowerShellTelemetry` and `Disable-PnPPowerShellTelemetry` to manage this file. (0.2.21)
