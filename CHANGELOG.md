- `Add-PnPNavigationNode` cmdlet documentation improved with additional example feature which shows how to add a navigation node as a label.
- Changed `Get-PnPSiteDesign` and `Invoke-PnPSiteDesign` to when providing a name through `-Identity` to be able to work with all site designs having that same name instead of just the first one
- Changed `Set-PnPListItemPermission` to support piping in a roledefinition for `-AddRole` and `-RemoveRole`
- Changed that `Get-PnPSiteScript -Identity` now also works with the site script name instead of just the site script Id
- Changed that `Get-PnPUnifiedAuditLog` returns the error being returned by the Office Management API service, in case something goes wrong [#1631](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/1631)

### Fixed

- Fixed an issue where running `Get-PnPSiteDesign -Identity` passing in an identifier that did not exist would return an exception [#1622](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/1622)

### Removed
- Removed `ConvertTo-PnPClientSidePage` cmdlet as it has been replaced by `ConvertTo-PnPPage`
this option is not enabled yet on your tenant in which case trying to set it results in to `Set-PnPTenant: The requested operation is part of an experimental feature that is not supported in the current environment.`. In that case try again later.
- Removed `Add-PnPUserToGroup` as it has been replaced by `Add-PnPGroupMember`
- Removed `Get-PnPGroupMembers` cmdlet alias and related warning. The cmdlet `Get-PnPGroupMember` (singular) is available.
- Removed `Remove-PnPUserFromGroup` cmdlet alias and related warning. The cmdlet `Remove-PnPGroupMember` is available.
- Removed `Initialize-PnPPowerShellAuthentication` cmdlet alias and related warning. The cmdlet `Register-PnPAzureADApp` is the replacement.

## [1.3.0]

### Added
- Added `-HideTitleInHeader` parameter to `Set-PnPWeb` to hide or show the title in the header. Use `-HideTitleInHeader` to hide it and `-HideTitleInHeader:$false` to show it.
- Added `-ShowContentUrl` parameter to `Register-PnPManagementShellAccess` retrieve the url to consent to the PnP Management Shell application by an administrator.
- Added `-IsFavoriteByDefault` parameter on Set-PnPTeamsChannel and Add-PnPTeamsChannel
- Added `-GroupIdDefined` boolean parameter to Get-PnPTenantSite to allow filtering on sites which belong to a Microsoft 365 Group
- Added `-Interactive` login option to `Connect-PnPOnline` which is similar to `-UseWebLogin` but without the limitations of the latter. The `-UseWebLogin` is using cookie based authentication towards SharePoint and cannot access Graph tokens. Using `-Interactive` we use Azure AD Authentication and as a result we are able to acquire Graph tokens.

### Changed
- Fixed certificate clean up issue on Windows platform when using `Connect-PnPOnline` with a certificate.
- Fixed issues with `Register-PnPAzureADApp` when using the various auth options (-DeviceLogin / -Interactive)
- Renamed the `-PnPManagementShell` option to `-DeviceLogin` on `Connect-PnPOnline`. `-PnPManagementShell` is still available as an alias.
- Added `-ClientId` option to `-DeviceLogin` allowing device code authentication with custom app registrations.
- Changed `-Url` parameter on Get-PnPTenantSite and Set-PnPTenantSite to `-Identity`. Made `-Url` available as an alias.
- Updated `Set-PnPTenantSite` to support same parameters as `Set-SPOSite`
- Updated `Get-PnPTenantSite` to return same properties as `Get-SPOSite`
- Fixed issue where `-Interactive` on `Connect-PnPOnline` would prompt for credentials when connecting to new site within same tenant. Added -ForceLogin parameter to force
- Get-PnPUser and any other cmdlet that takes a UserPipeBind parameter as input now allows users to be specified by name besides loginname or id.
- Fixed issue where retrieving a single site with Get-PnPTenantSite vs retrieving all sites showed different properties.
- Invoke-PnPSPRestMethod now returns usable objects
- Updated `Set-PnPListItem` to have an `UpdateType` parameter. Obsoleted `SystemUpdate`. Also updated the backend logic so can now also specify `UpdateOverwriteVersion` to update the editor, author, modified and created fields. 
- `Register-PnPAzureADApp` now outputs the base64 encoded version of the certificate which can be used with `Connect-PnPOnline -ClientId -CertificateBase64Encoded`
- Fixed issue with moving and copying files to subfolder, Issue #165. 
- fixed issue where Get-PnPTenantSite was not returning all properties correct, Issue #151
- Added `-Interactive` login option to Register-PnPManagementApp which allows for an interactive authentication flow not using device login for environments that require Multi-Factor Authentication.
- Updated all Microsoft365Group cmdlets to only load the SiteUrl of the underlying Microsoft 365 Group where required. This means that `Get-PnPMicrosoft365Group -Identity` will not by default load the site url. Specify `-IncludeSiteUrl` to include it.

## [0.2.*-nightly]

### Added
- Added `Convert-PnPSiteTemplateToMarkdown` to convert an existing XML based template to a markdown report. Notice that this is work in progress and the functionality will increase. See also the 'Changed' section below for information about `Get-PnPSiteTemplate` (0.3.5)
- Added `-UseWeblogin` and `-ForceAuthentication` to `Connect-PnPOnline` to allow using Multi-Factor Authentication. Notice this uses cookie based authentication, which is limited in its functionality. Using -UseWebLogin we will for instance not be able to acquire an access token for the Graph, and as a result none of the Graph related cmdlets will work. Also some of the functionality of the provisioning engine (`Get-PnPSiteTemplate`, `Get-PnPTenantTemplate`, `Invoke-PnPSiteTemplate`, `Invoke-PnPTenantTemplate`) will not work because of this reason. The cookies will in general expire within a few days and if you use `-UseWebLogin` within that time popup window will appear that will dissappear immediately, this is expected. Use `-ForceAuthentication` to reset the authentication cookies and force a new login. (0.2.25)
- Allowed to specify -ClientId when logging in with credentials so people can use their own Azure AD apps and credentials for authentication towards SharePoint Online (0.2.17)
- Added environment variable check (set `PNPPOWERSHELL_UPDATECHECK` to `Off`) to Connect-PnPOnline to skip version check if set. (0.2.15)
- Added `Get-PnPChangeLog` cmdlet which returns this changelog. (0.2.14)
- Added `-DeviceLogin` parameter to `Register-PnPAzureADApp` (renamed from Initialize-PnPPowerShellAuthentication in 0.2.15) which allows for users with MFA to setup a custom app (0.2.12)
- Added `NoVersionCheck` optional flag to `Connect-PnPOnline` [PR#28](https://github.com/pnp/powershell/pull/28) (0.2.9)
- Added native support for Secret Management Modules (0.1.34)
- Marked -ExcludeSiteUrl as obselete on `Get-PnPMicrosoft365Group` for performance reasons. Use -IncludeSiteUrl instead.
- Added -CloudShell switch to `Connect-PnPOnline` which can be used in the Azure Cloud Shell. If specified you will automatically authenticate using the current identity you're logged in with to the Azure Cloud Shell. Notice: only Graph based cmdlets (Teams, Microsoft Groups etc.) will function. For SharePoint connectivity use one of the other connection options with `Connect-PnPOnline`.
- Added -DisableCustomAppAuthentication to `Set-PnPTenant` and added support for DisableCustomAppAuthentication in `Get-PnPTenant`.

- Fixed issue with `-UseWebLogin` throws a 403 error when connecting to a different site collection than the root site collection.
- Removed `Enable-PnPPowerShellTelemetry` and `Disable-PnPPowerShellTelemetry`. See [Configure PnP PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell) for more information on how to enable or disable telemetry collection (0.2.22)
- Obsoleted `-NoTelemetry` and `-NoVersionCheck` on `Connect-PnPOnline`. You can set these as environment variables now. See [Configure PnP PowerShell](https://pnp.github.io/powershell) for more information (0.2.22)
- Updated telemetry handling. If the environment variable `PNPPOWERSHELL_DISABLETELEMETRY` is set to `true`, no telemetry will be recorded. If the .pnppowershelltelemetry file is present in the home folder of the user then the the contents of this file will override the environment variable settings.
