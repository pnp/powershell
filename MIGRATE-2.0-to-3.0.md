# Updating from PnP PowerShell 2.x to 3.x

_This is a draft document, version 3 is not yet available. You can try this out with the nightly builds starting from 2.99.1 or later_

The 3.x version of PnP PowerShell is based exclusively on .NET 8.0, which means that it will not work on older PowerShell editions like PowerShell 5.1, ISE or PowerShell 7.3 or older. PowerShell 7.4 or later is required.

- The 3.x version of PnP PowerShell will work only on PowerShell 7.4 or later versions.

## Steps to update from 2.x to 3.x

- Download and install the latest PowerShell version from [this GitHub releases link](https://aka.ms/powershell-release?tag=lts)

Or

- For Windows environments, please use [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-windows)

- For Linux based environments, please use [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-linux)

- For Mac OS environments, please use [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell-on-macos)

Once the PowerShell 7.4 or later is downloaded and installed in the environment, you can install the PnP PowerShell module like you normally do.

```powershell
Install-Module -Name "PnP.PowerShell"
```

If you want to install or update to the latest nightly built prerelease of PnP PowerShell, run:

```powershell
Install-Module -Name "PnP.PowerShell" -AllowPrerelease
```
