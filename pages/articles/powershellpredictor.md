# PnP PowerShell predictor

The PnP PowerShell predictor is easy to install and use. It provides great help in finding the cmdlet within PnP PowerShell you need and which parameters to provide to get the job done. It will show handy autocomplete options which are automatically generated each night based on the samples provided with each cmdlet in our documentation. This allows you to quickly pick not just the cmdlet you need, but also have all the parameters you need showing up already. You would then only still need to change the values of the parameters to match your scenario.

PnP PowerShell predictor can be installed as an add-on module to PnP PowerShell.

More information on how to set it up and to download it can be found on the [PnP PowerShell Predictor](https://github.com/anoopt/PnP.PowerShell.Predictor) GitHub page.
