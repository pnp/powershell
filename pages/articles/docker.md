# Using PnP PowerShell in Docker containers

Using Docker allows you to use any software inside virtual environments, without having to install this software directly on your laptop or server. These virtual environments are containers, which might be imagined as lightweight virtual machines. Having their own virtual disks, memory and processes, containers are rationally isolated from your laptop operating system, providing you a great way of experimenting and using any version of PnP.PowerShell without installing it.

The good news is that you will not even need to install PnP.PowerShell in containers by your own: the PnP team is already publishing Docker container images for each stable and nightly release, [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/m365pnp/powershell). You will however need to install docker runtime.

If you use Windows, we would recommend you using Linux containers with help of WSL. Alternatively, even though it is not the most common way, you might want to run PnP.PowerShell in Windows containers. Mind you that some use cases might be limited when using Windows containers. If you use Mac OS or Linux, the easiest way is to use Linux containers.

## Play with PnP.PowerShell online

You can try using m365pnp/powershell Docker containers online, without installing anything on your desktop/laptop.

1. Open https://labs.play-with-docker.com/

2. Login

3. Click `Start`

4. Click `+ ADD NEW INSTANCE`

5. Run in the online console:

    ```powershell
    docker run --rm -it m365pnp/powershell
    ```

After that you can start running commands like `Connect-PnPOnline`.

## Installing Docker locally

- Windows:

    ```powershell
    iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
    choco install -y docker-engine
    ```

    Or just download and install Docker manually from [here](https://www.docker.com/get-started/).

- Mac OS:

    1. Install

    ```bash
    brew install --cask docker
    ```

    2. Launch Docker:

        - Press âŒ˜ + Space to bring up Spotlight Search and enter Docker to launch Docker.
        - In the Docker needs privileged access dialog box, click OK.
        - Enter password and click OK.

- Linux:

    ```bash
    bash <(curl -s https://get.docker.com/)
    sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
    newgrp docker
    ```

- Linux containers on Windows (using WSL):

    1. Start installing WSL:

        ```powershell
        Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName "Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux", "VirtualMachinePlatform" -NoRestart
        Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi -OutFile wsl_update_x64.msi -UseBasicParsing
        Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList "/I $((Get-Location).Path)\wsl_update_x64.msi /quiet"
        ```

    2. Reboot the machine before you continue

    3. Finish installing WSL:

        ```powershell
        wsl --set-default-version 2
        wsl --install --distribution Ubuntu
        ```

    4. Install docker in WSL:

        ```bash
        bash <(curl -s https://get.docker.com/)
        sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
        newgrp docker
        ```

## Using PnP.PowerShell

Sometimes you want to run inline PnP.PowerShell commands.

- Latest stable version:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it m365pnp/powershell:latest
    ```

- Latest nightly version:

    ```powershell
    docker run --rm -it m365pnp/powershell:nightly
    ```

After that you can start running commands like `Connect-PnPOnline`.

Mind you that in the case above, the container will have an isolated disk system so the commands that you run inside the container will not be able to access files from your host machine. However, sometimes you might want to run a script or use some files from your host OS (for example, when you have a ps1 file in a git repository that you cloned to your laptop). In this case you will need to mount a directory on your host as a volume inside the container. See the following examples.

- Linux/WSL/Mac OS:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -it -v "$(pwd):/home" -w /home m365pnp/powershell
    ```

- Windows (run in PowerShell console):

    ```powershell
    docker run --rm -it -v "${pwd}:C:\workplace" -w C:\workplace m365pnp/powershell
    ```

In such container you can run `Get-ChildItem` and see the contents of the current directory.

The examples above start new container and allow you to interactively use container, running inline commands. In other cases however, you might want to just start a container for a short time (a few seconds maybe) and run a ps1 script unattended and then automatically terminate the container. Here is how you can do it.

- Linux/WSL/Mac OS:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/home" -w /home m365pnp/powershell pwsh test.ps1
    ```

- Windows (run in PowerShell console):

    ```powershell
    docker run --rm -v "${pwd}:C:\workplace" -w C:\workplace m365pnp/powershell:1.10.0-nanoserver-1809 pwsh test.ps1
    ```

Finally, your scripts might have parametrization so that you can run the same code in different cases/environments. This is the way to provide variable values.

- Linux/WSL/Mac OS:

    ```bash
    ParameterValue="test"
    docker run --rm -v "$(pwd):/home" -w /home m365pnp/powershell pwsh -c "./test.ps1 -Parameter1 $ParameterValue"
    ```

- Windows (run in PowerShell console):

    ```powershell
    $ParameterValue="test"
    docker run --rm -v "${pwd}:C:\workplace" -w C:\workplace m365pnp/powershell:1.10.0-nanoserver-1809 pwsh -c "./test.ps1 -Parameter1 $ParameterValue"
    ```

Please see [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/) to see arguments for `docker run` command.
