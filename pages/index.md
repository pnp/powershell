## I've found a bug, where do I need to log an issue or create a PR

You can create an issue at https://github.com/pnp/powershell/issues, but please consider first if asking a question at https://github.com/pnp/powershell/discussions is more appropriate. We would like to focus the issues on actual bugs whereas PnP PowerShell related questions can be asked in the discussions section.

As some of the code being PnP PowerShell is actually coming from other PnP repositories, we can move your issue over to that specific repository. You will be notified by email about that.

Before you start to work on code change consider starting a discussion in the repository first. It could potentially save you a lot of time if someone is about to submit a change with exactly the same functionality. It will also allow you to discuss a possible change with the maintainers of the repository before you start to work on it.

## Contributing to PnP PowerShell

Follow the [getting started contributing](/powershell/articles/gettingstartedcontributing.html) guidelines to help out. Sharing is caring!
