* Azure: management.azure.com

Exports a Microsoft Power Automate Flow

## SYNTAX

### As ZIP Package
```powershell
Export-PnPFlow -Environment <PowerAutomateEnvironmentPipeBind> -Identity <PowerAutomateFlowPipeBind>
 [-AsZipPackage] [-PackageDisplayName <String>] [-PackageDescription <String>] [-PackageCreatedBy <String>]
 [-PackageSourceEnvironment <String>] [-OutPath <String>] [-Force] [-Connection <PnPConnection>]
 
```

### As Json
```powershell
Export-PnPFlow -Environment <PowerAutomateEnvironmentPipeBind> -Identity <PowerAutomateFlowPipeBind>
 [-Connection <PnPConnection>] 
```

## DESCRIPTION
This cmdlet exports a Microsoft Power Automate Flow either as a json file or as a zip package.

Many times exporting a Microsoft Power Automate Flow will not be possible due to various reasons such as connections having gone stale, SharePoint sites referenced no longer existing or other configuration errors in the Flow. To display these errors when trying to export a Flow, provide the -Verbose flag with your export request. If not provided, these errors will silently be ignored.

## EXAMPLES

### Example 1
```powershell
$environment = Get-PnPPowerPlatformEnvironment -IsDefault $true
Export-PnPFlow -Environment $environment -Identity fba63225-baf9-4d76-86a1-1b42c917a182
```

This will export the specified Microsoft Power Automate Flow from the default Power Platform environment as an output to the current output of PowerShell

### Example 2
```powershell
Get-PnPPowerPlatformEnvironment | foreach { Get-PnPFlow -Environment $_.Name } | foreach { Export-PnPFlow -Environment $_.Properties.EnvironmentDetails.Name -Identity $_ -OutPath "c:\flows\$($_.Name).zip" -AsZipPackage }
```

This will export all the Microsoft Power Automate Flows available within the tenant from all users from all the available Power Platform environments as a ZIP package for each of them to a local folder c:\flows
