## DESCRIPTION
Connects to a SharePoint site or another API and creates a context that is required for the other PnP Cmdlets.
See https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/connecting.html for more information on the options to connect.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "contoso.sharepoint.com"
```

Connect to SharePoint prompting for the username and password.
When a generic credential is added to the Windows Credential Manager with https://contoso.sharepoint.com, PowerShell will not prompt for username and password and use those stored credentials instead.

### EXAMPLE 2
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "contoso.sharepoint.com" -Credentials (Get-Credential)
```

Connect to SharePoint prompting for the username and password to use to authenticate

### EXAMPLE 3
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "contoso.sharepoint.de" -ClientId 344b8aab-389c-4e4a-8fa1-4c1ae2c0a60d -ClientSecret $clientSecret
```

This will authenticate you to the site using Legacy ACS authentication

### EXAMPLE 4
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "contoso.sharepoint.com" -DeviceLogin
```

This will authenticate you using the PnP Management Shell Multi-Tenant application.
A browser window will have to be opened where you have to enter a code that is shown in your PowerShell window.

### EXAMPLE 5
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "contoso.sharepoint.com" -DeviceLogin -LaunchBrowser
```

This will authenticate you using the PnP Management Shell Multi-Tenant application.
A browser window will automatically open and the code you need to enter will be automatically copied to your clipboard.

### EXAMPLE 6
```powershell
$password = (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText 'myprivatekeypassword' -Force)
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "contoso.sharepoint.com" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -CertificatePath 'c:\mycertificate.pfx' -CertificatePassword $password  -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
```

Connects using an Azure Active Directory registered application using a locally available certificate containing a private key.
See https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread for a sample on how to get started.

### EXAMPLE 7
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "contoso.sharepoint.com" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' -Thumbprint 34CFAA860E5FB8C44335A38A097C1E41EEA206AA
```

Connects to SharePoint using app-only tokens via an app's declared permission scopes.
See https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/tree/master/Samples/SharePoint.ConnectUsingAppPermissions for a sample on how to get started.
Ensure you have imported the private key certificate, typically the .pfx file, into the Windows Certificate Store for the certificate with the provided thumbprint.

### EXAMPLE 8
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "contoso.sharepoint.com" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -CertificateBase64Encoded $base64encodedstring -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
```

Connects using an Azure Active Directory registered application using a certificate with a private key that has been base64 encoded.
See https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread for a sample on how to get started.

### EXAMPLE 9
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "contoso.sharepoint.com" -UseWebLogin
```

Note: See Example 10 as this is a preferred option over using -UseWebLogin.

Connects to SharePoint using legacy cookie based authentication.
Notice this type of authentication is limited in its functionality.
We will for instance not be able to acquire an access token for the Graph, and as a result none of the Graph related cmdlets will work.
Also some of the functionality of the provisioning engine (Get-PnPSiteTemplate, Get-PnPTenantTemplate, Invoke-PnPSiteTemplate, Invoke-PnPTenantTemplate) will not work because of this reason.
The cookies will in general expire within a few days and if you use -UseWebLogin within that time popup window will appear that will disappear immediately, this is expected.
Use -ForceAuthentication to reset the authentication cookies and force a new login.
See example 10 for a full support for interactive logins using MFA and the ability to acquire Graph tokens.

### EXAMPLE 10
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "contoso.sharepoint.com" -Interactive
```

Connects to the Azure AD, acquires an access token and allows PnP PowerShell to access both SharePoint and the Microsoft Graph.
By default it will use the PnP Management Shell multi-tenant application behind the scenes, so make sure to run \`Register-PnPManagementShellAccess\` first.

### EXAMPLE 11
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url "https://portal.contoso.com" -TransformationOnPrem -CurrentCredential
```

Connects to on-premises SharePoint 2013, 2016 or 2019 site with the current user's on-premises Windows credential (e.g. domain\user).
This option is only supported for being able to transform on-premises classic wiki, webpart, blog and publishing pages into modern pages in a SharePoint Online site.
Although other PnP cmdlets might work as well, they're officially not supported for being used in an on-premises context.
See http://aka.ms/sharepoint/modernization/pages for more details on page transformation.

### EXAMPLE 12
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -ManagedIdentity
Get-PnPTeamsTeam
```

Connects using a system assigned managed identity to Microsoft Graph. Using this way of connecting only works with environments that support managed identities: Azure Functions, Azure Automation Runbooks and the Azure Cloud Shell. Read up on [this article](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/azurefunctions.html#by-using-a-managed-identity) how it can be used.

### EXAMPLE 13
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -ManagedIdentity -UserAssignedManagedIdentityObjectId 363c1b31-6872-47fd-a616-574d3aec2a51
Get-PnPList
```

Connects using an user assigned managed identity with object/principal ID 363c1b31-6872-47fd-a616-574d3aec2a51 to SharePoint Online. Using this way of connecting only works with environments that support managed identities: Azure Functions, Azure Automation Runbooks and the Azure Cloud Shell. Read up on [this article](https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/azurefunctions.html#by-using-a-managed-identity) how it can be used.

### EXAMPLE 14
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -AccessToken $token
```

This method assumes you have acquired a valid OAuth2 access token from Azure AD with the correct audience and permissions set.
Using this method PnP PowerShell will not acquire tokens dynamically and if the token expires (typically after 1 hour) cmdlets will fail to work using this method.

### EXAMPLE 15
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -EnvironmentVariable -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com'
```

This example uses the `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH` and `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` environment variable values to authenticate. The `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable must be present and `Tenant` parameter value must be provided.

### EXAMPLE 16
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -EnvironmentVariable
```

This example uses the `AZURE_USERNAME` and `AZURE_PASSWORD` environment variables as credentials to authenticate. If `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` is not present, then it will try to use the default `PnP Management Shell Azure AD app` as fallback and attempt to authenticate.

This method assumes you have the necessary environment variables available. For more information about the required environment variables, please refer to this article, [Azure.Identity Environment Variables](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/main/sdk/identity/Azure.Identity#environment-variables) here.

So, when using `-EnvironmentVariable` method for authenticating, we will require `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH`, `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` and `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` environment variables for using the service principal with certificate method for authentication.

If `AZURE_USERNAME`, `AZURE_PASSWORD` and `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, we will use these environment variables and authenticate using credentials flow.

We support only Service principal with certificate and Username with password mode for authentication. Configuration will be attempted in that order. For example, if values for a certificate and username+password are both present, the client certificate method will be used.

### EXAMPLE 17
```
Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -AzureEnvironment Custom -MicrosoftGraphEndPoint "custom.graph.microsoft.com" -AzureADLoginEndPoint "https://custom.login.microsoftonline.com"
```

Use this method to connect to a custom Azure Environment. You can also specify the `MicrosoftGraphEndPoint` and `AzureADLoginEndPoint` parameters if applicable. If specified, then these values will be used to make requests to Graph and to retrieve access token.

### EXAMPLE 18
```powershell
Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -AzureADWorkloadIdentity
```

This example uses Azure AD Workload Identity to retrieve access tokens. For more information about this, please refer to this article, [Azure AD Workload Identity](https://azure.github.io/azure-workload-identity/docs/introduction.html). We are following the guidance mentioned in [this sample](https://github.com/Azure/azure-workload-identity/blob/main/examples/msal-net/akvdotnet/TokenCredential.cs) to retrieve the access tokens.

## PARAMETERS

### -AccessToken
Using this parameter you can provide your own access token.
Notice that it is recommend to use one of the other connection methods as this will limits the offered functionality on PnP PowerShell.
For instance if the token expires (typically after 1 hour) will not be able to acquire a new valid token, which the other connection methods do allow.
You are responsible for providing your own valid access token when using this parameter, for the correct audience, with the correct permissions scopes.

```

### -ValidateConnection
When provided, the cmdlet will check to ensure the SharePoint Online site specified through `-Url` exists and if not, will throw an exception. If you omit this flag or set it to $false, it will blindly set up a connection without validating that the site actually exists. Making use of this option does make one extra call on the connection attempt, so it is recommended to only use it in scenarios where you know the site you're trying to connect o may not exist and would like to have feedback on this during the connect.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter

```

### -UseWebLogin
Windows only: Connects to SharePoint using legacy cookie based authentication.
Notice this type of authentication is limited in its functionality.
We will for instance not be able to acquire an access token for the Graph, and as a result none of the Graph related cmdlets will work.
Also some of the functionality of the provisioning engine (Get-PnPSiteTemplate, Get-PnPTenantTemplate, Invoke-PnPSiteTemplate, Invoke-PnPTenantTemplate) will not work because of this reason.
The cookies will in general expire within a few days and if you use -UseWebLogin within that time popup window will appear that will disappear immediately, this is expected.
Use -ForceAuthentication to reset the authentication cookies and force a new login.

We support only Service principal with certificate and Username with password mode for authentication. Configuration will be attempted in that order. For example, if values for a certificate and username+password are both present, the client certificate method will be used. By default, it will use the `-ClientId` specified in `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable. If that value is empty, it will fallback to the PnP Management Shell Azure AD App.
