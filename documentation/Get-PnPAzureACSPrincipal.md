# Get-PnPAzureACSPrincipal

## SYNOPSIS

**Required Permissions**

* SharePoint: Access to the SharePoint Tenant Administration site

Returns the list of Azure ACS Principals

## SYNTAX

```powershell
Get-PnPAzureACSPrincipal [-Scope <AzureACSPrincipalScope>] [-IncludeSubsites <SwitchParameter>] [-Connection <PnPConnection>]
```

## DESCRIPTION

This cmdlet provides insight into the app registrations that have been done over time using AppRegNew.aspx. You could look at it as a (detailed) equivallent of AppPrincipals.aspx. This information can help to get insights into the app registrations that have been done on a tenant and prepare for the Azure Access Control Services (ACS) deprecation that will follow in the future.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```powershell
Get-PnPAzureACSPrincipal
```

Returns the Azure ACS principals

### EXAMPLE 2
```powershell
Get-PnPAzureACSPrincipal -IncludeSubsites
```

Returns the lists of Azure ACS principals installed in your site collection as well as the subsites. The ValidUntil property will not be populated in this scenario.

### EXAMPLE 3
```powershell
Get-PnPAzureACSPrincipal -Scope Tenant
```

Returns the lists of Azure ACS principals installed in your Tenant. This a very heavy operation, so it might take some time before we get the results.

### EXAMPLE 4
```powershell
Get-PnPAzureACSPrincipal -Scope All -IncludeSubsites
```

Returns the lists of all Azure ACS principals installed in your Tenant including subsites. This a very heavy operation, so it might take some time before we get the results.

## PARAMETERS

### -Connection
Optional connection to be used by the cmdlet. Retrieve the value for this parameter by either specifying -ReturnConnection on Connect-PnPOnline or by executing Get-PnPConnection.

```yaml
Type: PnPConnection
Parameter Sets: (All)

Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -Scope
When specified, it determines the scope of the Azure ACS principals. 
Supported values are `List, Web, Site, Tenant , All`.
Only with `Tenant` and `All` the `ValidUntil` property will be populated. For the other options it will not, this is by design and makes the cmdlet perform faster.

Parameter Sets: (All)
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: List
Accept pipeline input: False
Accept wildcard characters: False
```

### -IncludeSubsites
When specified, it determines whether we should use also search the subsites of the connected site collection and lists the Azure ACS principals.

```yaml
Type: SwitchParameter
Parameter Sets: (All)
Required: False
Position: Named
Default value: None
Accept pipeline input: False
