## DESCRIPTION

Copies a folder or file to a different location within SharePoiint. This location can be within the same document library, same site, same site collection or even to another site collection on the same tenant. Notice that if copying between sites or to a subsite you cannot specify a target filename, only a folder name.

Copying files and folders is bound to some restrictions. You can find more on it here: https://learn.microsoft.com/office365/servicedescriptions/sharepoint-online-service-description/sharepoint-online-limits#moving-and-copying-across-sites

It can also accommodate copying an entire folder with all its files and optionally even subfolders and files from a local path onto SharePoint Online.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```powershell
Copy-PnPFolder -SourceUrl "Shared Documents/MyProjectfiles" -TargetUrl "/sites/otherproject/Shared Documents" -Overwrite
```

Copies a folder named MyProjectFiles in the document library called Documents located in the current site to the root folder of the library named Documents in the site collection otherproject. If a folder named MyProjectFiles already exists, it will overwrite it.

### EXAMPLE 2
```powershell
Copy-PnPFolder -SourceUrl "/sites/project/Shared Documents/company.docx" -TargetUrl "/sites/otherproject/Shared Documents"
```

Copies a file named company.docx located in a document library called Shared Documents in the site collection project to the Shared Documents library in the site collection otherproject. If a file named company.docx already exists, it won't perform the copy.

### EXAMPLE 3

Copy-PnPFolder -SourceUrl "Shared Documents/company.docx" -TargetUrl "/sites/otherproject/Shared Documents" -IgnoreVersionHistory
```

Copies a file named company.docx located in a document library called Documents in the current site to the site collection otherproject. If a file named company.docx already exists, it won't perform the copy. Only the latest version of the file will be copied and its history will be discarded.

```

Copies a folder named Archive located in a document library called Shared Documents in the site collection project to the Shared Documents library in the site collection otherproject. If a folder named Archive already exists, it will overwrite it.
