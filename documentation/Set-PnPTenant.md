## DESCRIPTION
Sets organization-level tenant properties which impact the entire tenant.

You must have the SharePoint Online admin or Global admin role to run the cmdlet.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```powershell
Set-PnPTenantSite -Identity "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team1" -LockState NoAccess
Set-PnPTenant -NoAccessRedirectUrl "http://www.contoso.com"
```

This example blocks access to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/team1 and redirects traffic to http://www.contoso.com.

### EXAMPLE 2
```powershell
Set-PnPTenant -ShowEveryoneExceptExternalUsersClaim $false
```

This example hides the "Everyone Except External Users" claim in People Picker.

### EXAMPLE 3
```powershell
Set-PnPTenant -ShowAllUsersClaim $false
```

This example hides the "All Users" claim group in People Picker.

### EXAMPLE 4
```powershell

### -OneDriveLoopSharingCapability

When sharing a whiteboard in a Teams meeting, Whiteboard creates a sharing link that’s accessible by anyone within the organization and automatically shares the whiteboard with any in-tenant users in the meeting.

There’s an additional capability for temporary collaboration by external and shared device accounts during a meeting. This allows these users to temporarily view and collaborate on whiteboards when they’re shared in a Teams meeting, similar to PowerPoint Live sharing.

If you have the external sharing for OneDrive for Business allowed, no further action is required. If you have external sharing for OneDrive for Business disabled, you can leave it disabled but you must enable this new setting. The setting will not take effect until the SharingCapability 'ExternalUserAndGuestSharing' is also enabled at Tenant level. For more information, see [Enable Microsoft Whiteboard for your organization](https://support.microsoft.com/office/enable-microsoft-whiteboard-for-your-organization-1caaa2e2-5c18-4bdf-b878-2d98f1da4b24).

### -AllowAnonymousMeetingParticipantsToAccessWhiteboards

When you share a whiteboard in a Teams meeting, Whiteboard creates a sharing link. This link is accessible by anyone within the organization. The whiteboard is also shared with any in-tenant users in the meeting. Whiteboards are shared using company-shareable links, regardless of the default setting. Support for the default sharing link type is planned.

There's more capability for temporary collaboration by external and shared device accounts during a Teams meeting. Users can temporarily view and collaborate on whiteboards that are shared in a meeting, in a similar way to PowerPoint Live sharing.

In this case, Whiteboard provides temporary viewing and collaboration on the whiteboard during the Teams meeting only. A share link isn't created and Whiteboard doesn't grant access to the file.

If you have external sharing enabled for OneDrive for Business, no further action is required.

If you restrict external sharing for OneDrive for Business, you can keep it restricted, and just enable this new setting in order for external and shared device accounts to work.

### -BlockDownloadFileTypePolicy

You can block the download of Teams meeting recording files from SharePoint or OneDrive. This allows users to remain productive while addressing the risk of accidental data loss. Users have browser-only access to play the meeting recordings with no ability to download or sync files or access them through apps.

This policy applies to new meeting recordings across the entire organization. You can exempt people who are members of specified security groups from the policy. This allows you to specify governance or compliance specialists who should have download access to meeting recordings.

After the policy is turned on, any new Teams meeting recording files created by the Teams service and saved in SharePoint and OneDrive are blocked from download.

Because this policy affects meeting recordings stored in OneDrive and SharePoint, you must be a SharePoint administrator to configure it.

Note that this policy doesn't apply to manually uploaded meeting recording files. For more details, see [Block the download of Teams meeting recording files from SharePoint or OneDrive.](https://learn.microsoft.com/microsoftteams/block-download-meeting-recording)
