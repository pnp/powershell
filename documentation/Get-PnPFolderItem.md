## SYNTAX

### Folder via url

## DESCRIPTION

This cmdlet allows listing of all the content in a folder. It can be used to list all files and folders in a folder and optionally all its subfolders.

Use [Get-PnPFileInFolder](Get-PnPFileInFolder.md) to retrieve only files and [Get-PnPFolderInFolder](Get-PnPFolderInFolder.md) to retrieve only folders allowing additional properties of the returned items to be requested.

Get-PnPFolderItem
```
