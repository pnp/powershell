## DESCRIPTION

Allows sending an e-mail through SharePoint Online or Microsoft Graph. Sending e-mail through Microsoft Graph requires the **Mail.Send** permission.

In October 2025, [Microsoft will remove the API](https://support.microsoft.com/office/retirement-of-the-sharepoint-sendemail-api-b35bbab1-7d09-455f-8737-c2de63fe0821) which is being used to send e-mail through SharePoint. It is therefore highly recommended to use the Microsoft Graph option listed above instead.

## EXAMPLES

### EXAMPLE 1
```powershell
Send-PnPMail -From "user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -To "recipient@contoso.com" -Subject "Test message" -Body "This is a test message"
```

Sends an e-mail using Microsoft Graph to one recipient. E-mail is sent from the user specified in the From parameter and can be sent to both internal and external addresses. A copy of the sent e-mail will be stored in the mailbox of the user specified in the From parameter.

### EXAMPLE 2
```powershell
Send-PnPMail -From "sharedmailbox@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -To "recipient1@contoso.com","recipient2@contoso.com","recipient3@contoso.com" -Cc "recipient4@contoso.com" -Bcc "recipient5@contoso.com" -Subject "Test message" -Body "This is a test message" -Importance Low
```

Sends an e-mail using Microsoft Graph from a shared mailbox to multiple recipients. E-mail is sent from the shared mailbox specified in the From parameter and can be sent to both internal and external addresses. A copy of the sent e-mail will be stored in the shared mailbox.

### EXAMPLE 3
```powershell
Send-PnPMail -To "address@tenant.microsoftonline.com" -Subject "Test message" -Body "This is a test message"
```

Sends an e-mail using the SharePoint Online SendEmail method using the current context. E-mail is sent from the SharePoint Online no-reply e-mail address and can only be sent to accounts in the same tenant. The from address will show the title of the site you are connected with along with the e-mail address no-reply@sharepointonline.com.

### EXAMPLE 4
```powershell
Send-PnPMail -From "user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -To "recipient@contoso.com" -Subject "Test message" -Body "This is a test message" -Attachments "C:\PnPCommunity\Test\test.docx"
```

Sends an e-mail using Microsoft Graph to one recipient. E-mail is sent from the user specified in the From parameter and can be sent to both internal and external addresses. A copy of the sent e-mail will be stored in the mailbox of the user specified in the From parameter. It will also upload the file from the local file system as attachment.

### EXAMPLE 5
```powershell
Send-PnPMail -From "user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com" -To "recipient@contoso.com" -Subject "Test message" -Body "This is a test message" -Files "/sites/test/Shared Documents/Test.docx"
```

Sends an e-mail using Microsoft Graph to one recipient. E-mail is sent from the user specified in the From parameter and can be sent to both internal and external addresses. A copy of the sent e-mail will be stored in the mailbox of the user specified in the From parameter. It will also upload the file from the SharePoint site collection and send it as attachment.
