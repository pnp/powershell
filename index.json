    "keywords": "ACS Deprecation As announced back in November 2023 already, Microsoft will deprecate ACS (Access Control Services) for new tenants as of November 1st, 2024 and it will stop working for existing tenants and will be fully retired as of April 2nd, 2026. This applies to all environments including Government Clouds and Department of Defense. In essence, we're talking about the _layouts/appregnew.aspx, _layouts/appinv.aspx and _layouts/appprincipals.aspx pages that will be going away. What does this mean for me? If you're using any application registrations that have formerly been set up through _layouts/appregnew.aspx, it will stop working on above mentioned dates. It does not matter if you're using it with PnP PowerShell, through an SharePoint Add-In, direclty using CSOM (Client Side Object Model), direct _api calls to SharePoint, or any other means. What can I do to ensure my applications remain working Simple: replace them with a proper Entra ID Application Registration. If the _layouts/apprenew.aspx was done in December 2024 or later, it will already have created an Entra ID Application registration for you. To validate this, simply take the Client ID/App Id of your application, go to Entra ID, navigate to Identity > Applications > App registrations, click on the \"All applications\" tab and search for your Client ID/App ID. If it yields a result, it means your application also exists in Entra ID. If you go into the Entra ID Application registration and click on API permissions you will likely see no permissions being added to it. This is a clear indicator that this application registration has been done through _layouts/appregnew.aspx in or after December 2024, that it created an Entra ID Application registration counterpart, but that it still leverages ACS for its authentication. Add the required permissions here to ensure you can use this Entra ID Application registraton going forward. If you cannot find an entry in Entra ID with the same Client ID/App ID, it means the _layouts/appregnew.aspx operation has been done before December 2024 and no entry exists for it yet in Entra ID. You can manually create your own new Entra ID Application registration or use Register-PnPAzureADApp to create one for you. How to I find out about which ACS Application Registrations my tenant has Using the Microsoft 365 Assessment Tool One way would be to use the Microsoft 365 Assessment Tool to have it generate an overview for you which will list out where ACS application registrations are being used. Using PnP PowerShell Another option would be to create something yourself using PnP PowerShell. The advantage of this option could be that you can easily automate the entire process, from detecting ACS Application registrations, to creating their Entra ID Application registration counterparts, to setting permissions on them. To find out which ACS Application registrations exist on your tenant, you can leverage Get-PnPAzureACSPrincipal to connect to each site collection and execute: Get-PnPAzureACSPrincipal -IncludeSubsites Ensure the Entra ID Application registration you connect with to SharePoint Online to perform this cmdlet has at least delegated Sites.FullControl.All permissions on SharePoint and delegated Application.Read.All permissions on Microsoft Graph. The output of this cmdlet will be a list of ACS Application registrations that exist on that site. Under its SiteCollectionScopedPermissions and TenantScopedPermissions you will find the permissions that have been set on each of these. For example, to pull down these details for the first ACS Application registration on the site collection scoped permissions, run: Get-PnPAzureACSPrincipal -IncludeSubsites | Select -First 1 -ExpandProperty SiteCollectionScopedPermissions It produces an output similar to: The SiteId, WebId and ListId columns in this output, give away what kind of permissions have been set on the ACS Application registration. If a column contains just zeroes (00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000), it means the permissions have not been set down to that level. If it contains something else (i.e. 5c7836e9-a6fb-450f-a117-43ccea341193), it means that permissions have been set on that level. So to make it concrete, for the above sample, the following permissions have been set on this ACS Application Registration: FullControl on the Web scope Read on the list with id e94218ca-30d1-4118-a9b0-33e00f00d139 Read on the list with id f037e2d7-78e7-4ccd-bce9-ac81843b6bcc Write on the site collection scope With this information, you can now start mapping these permissions to the equivallents in Entra ID. For direct access to SharePoint, the most fine grained permission you can select for now would be Sites.Selected, which provides read, write, manage or full control access to an entire site collection. Nothing more fine grained. Alternatively you could rewrite your code to make its calls through Microsoft Graph instead of directly towards SharePoint Online, in which case you do have more fine grained permissions. The above example again would map to: Sites.Selected Use Grant-PnPAzureADAppSitePermission to set FullControl permissions on it. What do I need to change in my code? PnP PowerShell If you were connecting using PnP PowerShell, you will have to switch to using a certificate instead of a clientsecret and update your Connect-PnPOnline to something such as: Connect-PnPOnline https://contoso.sharepoint.com -CertificatePath c:\\temp\\pnp.pfx -Clientid xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx -Tenant xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx-xxx For all the possible connection options, check the documentation of Connect-PnPOnline. PnP Core There are many ways to connect through PnP Core. Also in this scenario, you will have to authenticate using a Client ID and Certificate. There's no one off sample that works for every scenario. Have a look at the PnP Core Authentication documentation for inspiration towards the possible options. CSOM Here as well you need to use a certificate to connect. A sample piece of code demonstrating how to do this using the native Client Side Object Model (CSOM) is: using Microsoft.Identity.Client; using Microsoft.SharePoint.Client; using System; using System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates; class Program { static void Main() { string siteUrl = \"https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/yoursite\"; string tenantId = \"your-tenant-id\"; string clientId = \"your-client-id\"; string certThumbprint = \"your-cert-thumbprint\"; string authority = $\"https://login.microsoftonline.com/{tenantId}\"; // Load certificate from store var store = new X509Store(StoreLocation.CurrentUser); store.Open(OpenFlags.ReadOnly); var cert = store.Certificates.Find(X509FindType.FindByThumbprint, certThumbprint, false)[0]; store.Close(); // Acquire token var app = ConfidentialClientApplicationBuilder.Create(clientId) .WithCertificate(cert) .WithAuthority(new Uri(authority)) .Build(); string[] scopes = { \"https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/.default\" }; var result = app.AcquireTokenForClient(scopes).ExecuteAsync().Result; // Connect to SharePoint using (var context = new ClientContext(siteUrl)) { context.ExecutingWebRequest += (sender, e) => { e.WebRequestExecutor.RequestHeaders[\"Authorization\"] = \"Bearer \" + result.AccessToken; }; Web web = context.Web; context.Load(web); context.ExecuteQuery(); Console.WriteLine(\"Connected to site: \" + web.Title); } } }"

    "title": "Authentication | PnP PowerShell",
    "keywords": "Authentication Before you can authenticate using PnP PowerShell, you need to ensure you have created your own application registration first and that you have set the proper permissions on the application registration. PnP PowerShell offers many different ways to authenticate to your tenant. Based on what you would like to achieve, pick the method that best suits your needs below. Instead of having to provide -ClientId on every connect, you can also opt to configure a default Client ID that will be used if -ClientID is not being specified in your Connect-PnPOnline. Interactive Authentication This is the easiest method to authenticate, but it requires you to enter your credentials and go through multi factor authentication and conditional access policy steps, if applicable, each time you connect. This works perfectly well if your intend is to manually run scripts, but is not suitable to run unattended scripts at i.e. timed intervals. Connecting can be done using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -Interactive -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> This will show a popup window which will allow to authenticate and step through the multi-factor authentication flow. Ensure you provide the Client ID of your own Entra ID Application Registration with the -ClientId parameter. Authenticating from another device or specific browser In some scenarios it can happen that you need to authenticate to PnP PowerShell from a different device or through a specific browser. In these cases you can use the -DeviceLogin method to connect. A sample scenario could for example be when running PnP PowerShell scripts on a Raspberry Pi without a desktop environment installed on it. In this case there is no browser to authenticate through on the device itself. Connecting can be done using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -DeviceLogin -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> When running this line, it will prompt in text to go to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin on any device and log in using a specific code which will be shown in the text. You can perform this step on any device. This does not have to be the same device as you're using PnP PowerShell on. After going to that website and entering the code shown in the text, you can complete the interactive login process as normal, including any multi factor authentication requirements that might have been set up for your account. Once the authentication completes, PnP PowerShell will automatically detect this and will be ready to be used. Authenticating using Web Account Manager Another option to authenticate is using Web Account Manager (WAM). WAM is a more secure & faster way of authenticating in Windows OS. It supports Windows Hello, FIDO keys, single sign on, conditional access policies, and more. It only works on Windows 10 (Version 1703 - Creators Update) and above, as well as Windows Server 2019 and above. Connecting can be done using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -OSLogin -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> Non interactive Authentication If your goal is to automatically connect to PnP PowerShell without user intervention of having to enter credentials or perform multi factor authentication steps, this is the method to go with. Ensure you have gone through the steps to set up an App Only application registration first. Your application registration needs to use a public/private key pair certificate to authenticate. A client secret is not supported. The public key (.cer) goes into your application registration in Entra ID, the private key (.pfx) will be used to connect using PnP PowerShell. Depending on how you have the certificate available, choose the section below that matches your scenario. Non interactive Authentication using a certificate file If you have the private key certificate (.pfx) stored as a physical file on your machine, you can connecting using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> -Tenant <tenant>.onmicrosoft.com -CertificatePath <path to your .pfx certificate> If your private key (.pfx) certificate has a password on it, add -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText 'myprivatekeypassword' -Force) to the parameters. Non interactive Authentication using a certificate in the Windows Certificate Store If you have the private key certificate (.pfx) added to the Windows Certificate Store (certmgr. msc) in the Personal > Certificates branch on your machine, you can connecting using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> -Tenant <tenant>.onmicrosoft.com -Thumbprint <thumbprint that can be found in the certificate> Non interactive Authentication using a base64 representation of the certificate This scenario is typically used when having the private key certificate (.pfx) stored as base64. This can for example be the case when using PnP PowerShell within Azure Functions. In this case you can connect using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> -Tenant <tenant>.onmicrosoft.com -CertificateBase64Encoded <base64 encoded pfx certificate> If your private key (.pfx) certificate has a password on it, add -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText 'myprivatekeypassword' -Force) to the parameters. If you wish to convert a private key certificate file to its Base64 encoded equivalent, you can use: $bytes = Get-Content '.\\PnPPowerShell.pfx' -AsByteStream $encodedPfx = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes) Authenticating by providing an access token A really specific and limited scenario is where you provide the oAuth JWT access token yourself that needs to be used to access resources. You can only pass in one access token and you need to ensure the token is still within its validity period and has the proper audience and scopes for the cmdlets you are going to execute. I.e. if you pass in an access token for your SharePoint Online tenant, you can only execute cmdlets that will directly target your SharePoint Online environment. If you would use a cmdlet that communicates with Microsoft Graph behind the scenes, it will throw an access denied exception. Connecting can be done using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -AccessToken <oAuth JWT access token> Authenticating with Credentials This method allows you to connect by just providing your username and password. It will not work with multi factor authentication. Therefore this method is less recommended. Connecting can be done using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> -Credentials (Get-Credential) and you will be prompted for credentials. Ensure you provide the Client ID of your own Entra ID Application Registration with the -ClientId parameter. Authenticating with pre-stored credentials using the Windows Credential Manager (Windows only) This method can be used if you just intend to use PnP PowerShell on a Windows device, you want to use just a username and password for an account that does not require multi factor authentication, and you wish to store these credentials in the Windows Credential Manager so you don't have to enter them every time you connect. As this will not work with multi factor authentication, this method is less recommended. Adding your credentials to the Windows Credential Manager, which is a one time operation, can be done using: Add-PnPStoredCredential -Name \"yourlabel\" -Username youruser@domain.com You will be prompted to provide a password. After that you can login using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> -Credentials \"yourlabel\" When you create the stored credentials (with Add-PnPStoredCredential or any other tool) if the Name you give it is the URL for your tenant you can omit the -Credentials parameter with Connect-PnPOnline. Using the example above create your stored credential with this command: Add-PnPStoredCredential -Name \"https://[yourtenant].sharepoint.com\" -Username youruser@contoso.com When connecting to https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com you can use this command: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> Connect-PnPOnline will look through the Windows Credential Manager for a credential matching the URL. If it finds one it will use it. It will also match that credential with deeper connection URLs like https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/IT. You can create additional stored credentials for deeper sites if you routinely connect to them with different credentials. If you want to connect with a different set of credentials you can use the -Credentials parameter to specify them. A stored credential can be used for other URLs, like the Admin site: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant]-admin.sharepoint.com -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> -Credentials https://[yourtenant].sharepoint.com Authenticating with pre-stored credentials using the Secrets Management Module from Microsoft (Multi-Platform) This method can be used if you just intend to use PnP PowerShell on a Windows, Linux or iOS device, you want to use just a username and password for an account that does not require multi factor authentication, and you wish to store these credentials in the a Credential Manager so you don't have to enter them every time you connect. As this will not work with multi factor authentication, this method is less recommended. Adding your credentials to the Credential Manager, which is a one time operation, can be done using: Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement -AllowPrerelease Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore -AllowPrerelease Set-SecretStoreConfiguration Set-Secret -Name \"yourlabel\" -Secret (Get-Credential) This creates a new secret vault on your computer. You will be asked to provide a password to access the vault. If you access the vault you will be prompted for that password. In case you want to want to write automated scripts you will have to turn off this password prompt as follows: Set-SecretStoreConfiguration -Authentication None For more information about these cmdlets, check out the github repositories: https://github.com/powershell/secretmanagement and https://github.com/powershell/secretstore. After you set up the vault and you added a credential, you can connect using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> -Credentials (Get-Secret -Name \"yourlabel\") Authentication to GCC or National Cloud environments In order to connect to a GCC or a national cloud environment, ensure you have followed the specific steps for setting up the application registration for national clouds. Connecting can be done using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -Interactive -ClientId [clientid] -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -AzureEnvironment [USGovernment|USGovernmentHigh|USGovernmentDoD|Germany|China] The AzureEnvironment parameter only allows one value. Select the correct one that matches your cloud deployment. Silent Authentication with Credentials for running in Pipelines For running Connect-PnPOnline with user credentials in Azure DevOps pipeline, you need to make sure that authentication in your Entra ID application is configured to allow public client. Public client can be configured from the Azure portal from the Authentication Blade in the application or by setting the allowPublicClient property in the application's manifest to true. username and password for service account can be stored as secret pipeline variables and can be referenced in the script to achieve complete automation. Silent Authentication with Credentials and MFA for running in Azure DevOps Pipelines with Microsoft Hosted Agents Identify the possible IP ranges for Microsoft-hosted agents Identify the region for your organization in Organization settings. Identify the Azure Geography for your organization's region. Map the names of the regions in your geography to the format used in the weekly file, following the format of AzureCloud., such as AzureCloud.westus. You can map the names of the regions from the Azure Geography list to the format used in the weekly file. You can find the weekly IP file at the following URL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519 For example, if your organization is located in the South East Asia region, you would map it to the format AzureCloud.SouthEastAsia. Create a named location in Entra ID conditional access Go to Entra ID conditional access Open named location blade, click on + IP Ranges Location Enter the IP ranges for Microsoft Hosted Agents, Mark as trusted location should be checked. Create a conditional access policy Go to Entra ID conditional access, click on +New Policy. Give a meaningful name, click on Users and Groups -> Include select users and groups, select the user with which you want to run your pipeline. Include all cloud apps. Under conditions -> locations include any locations and exclude the recently created named location. Under grant -> choose grant access. Only require multifactor authentication needs to be checked. Enable the policy and click on Save. Important You need to make sure that the new policy does not conflicts with any other policy in your tenant, otherwise make the changes accordingly. Powershell script to be run in pipeline $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList ($username, $password) Connect-PnPOnline -Url <site url> -Credentials $creds -ClientId <Application/Client ID of Entra ID app>"

Add the PnP PowerShell module to the Azure Automation Account To add PnP PowerShell to the Azure Automation Account, follow these steps: Navigate to Modules which is located the left side menu of the function app under the Shared Resources header. Click on Add a module at the top of the screen Choose from the following options: Specific stable version Important Currently the only stable PnP PowerShell version that works with Azure Automation 7.2 Runbooks is 2.12.0. Later versions are currently not supported. If you would like to use a latest nightly build instead, use the below instructions Select Browse from gallery, Runtime version 7.2 (recommended) and click on the Click here to browse from gallery link Search for PnP PowerShell and select the first result. Click on Select to confirm. Click on Import to start the download and importing process. It will take up to 10 minutes for the import to complete. You can check the import status by changing the Module type filter to Custom. Once it's done, it will show the status Available Latest prerelease version If you wish to use the latest prerelease/nightly build version, open up a PowerShell 7 console and execute: Save-Module PnP.PowerShell -AllowPrerelease -Path c:\\temp Using Windows File Explorer, go to the folder where you downloaded the PnP PowerShell package. You should see a folder called PnP.PowerShell in there. Right click on it and choose the option Compress to ZIP file.

Once it's done, it will show the status Available Decide how you want to authenticate in your Azure Automation Runbooks By using a Managed Identity The recommended option is to use a managed identity in Azure to allow your Azure Automation Runbook to connect to Microsoft Graph or SharePoint Online using PnP PowerShell. Using this method, you specifically grant permissions for your Azure Runbook to access these permissions, without having any client secret or certificate pair that potentially could fall into wrong hands. This makes this option the most secure option by far. Since version 1.11.95-nightly, Managed Identities are both supported against SharePoint Online as well as Microsoft Graph cmdlets. Before this version, only Microsoft Graph was being supported. Enabling the managed identity for an Azure Automation Runbook In your Azure Automation account, in the left menu, go to Identity under Account Settings Ensure you are on the System assigned tab and flip the switch for Status to On, if not already done Click the Save button and confirm your action in the dialog box that will be shown A new entry will now automatically be created in your Azure Active Directory for this app having the same name as your Azure Function and the Object (principal) ID shown on this page. Take notice of the Object (principal) ID. We will need it in the next section to assign permissions to. Assigning permissions to the managed identity Next step is to assign permissions to this managed identity so it is authorized to access the Microsoft Graph and/or SharePoint Online. If you don't know which permissions exist yet, you can use the below sample to get a list of all available permissions: Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipal -BuiltInType MicrosoftGraph | Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAvailableAppRole Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipal -BuiltInType SharePointOnline | Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAvailableAppRole Once you know which permissions you would like to assign, you can use the below samples. Note that the Principal requires the object Id (not the application/client id) or the application name. Add-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAppRole -Principal \"62614f96-cb78-4534-bf12-1f6693e8237c\" -AppRole \"Group.Read.All\" -BuiltInType MicrosoftGraph Add-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAppRole -Principal \"mymanagedidentity\" -AppRole \"Sites.FullControl.All\" -BuiltInType SharePointOnline Create a Runbook We're now ready to create a Runbook in which your PnP PowerShell script will run.

    "keywords": "Using PnP PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell In this article we will explain how to use PnP PowerShell inside Azure Cloud Shell. Using Azure Cloud Shell can come in handy in several scenarios. For example if policies on your local machine block you from installing PowerShell modules, you're behind a proxy which causes problems for your requests or you're on a shared machine which you don't want to pollute. With Azure Cloud Shell you open a PowerShell session which runs within Azure and outputs to you through i.e. a normal web browser via shell.azure.com, Windows Terminal or using any of the growing numbers of locations throughout the Microsoft products where the Azure Cloud Shell icon is visible (Microsoft 365 Admin Center, Teams Admin Center, Azure Portal, etc.). Requirements You need to have access to an Azure Subscription. The usage of Azure Cloud Shell itself is free, however it requires an Azure File Share with Storage Account behind it to store files, which is billed against normal rates. A Visual Studio subscription with Azure Benefits is ideal to use for this. Set up Azure Cloud Shell If you haven't used Azure Cloud Shell yet, follow these steps to get it going: Open a web browser and go to https://shell.azure.com Follow the steps on the screen. When asked to choose between Bash or PowerShell, choose PowerShell. When asked to create a new storage account, use the default or go for advanced if you wish to specify the names of the components yourself. Once done, you should be seeing a blue PowerShell like environment running from your browser. Add PnP PowerShell to your Azure Cloud Shell After completing the steps of the previous paragraph to get Azure Cloud Shell set up for your account, you can now add PnP PowerShell to your environment. You only need to do this once. Every time you return to Azure Cloud Shell, it will still have the module available to be used. You still have to manually update it to a newer version of PnP PowerShell, once one will be released, though, just like locally. In the Azure Cloud Shell, on the prompt, enter Install-Module PnP.PowerShell -AllowPrerelease If asked to confirm that you wish to install the module from an untrusted repository, respond with Y Connecting to your Microsoft 365 Environment from Azure Cloud Shell Not every available option within PnP PowerShell to authenticate will work due to the Azure Cloud Shell not being able to show a visual login screen. Choose below how you will authenticate. By using Device Login Using the Device Login option will allow you to use any browser session on any device to authenticate your Azure Cloud Shell connection attempt. Follow these steps to do so. In Azure Cloud Shell, enter: Connect-PnPOnline https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com -DeviceLogin Open a web browser on any device and navigate to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin Type over or copy/paste the code shown in the yellow area of the Azure Cloud Shell Log in with the account you wish to connect the Azure Cloud Shell with to your Microsoft 365 environment Click on Continue to confirm you are logging on to the PnP Management Shell You can now safely close the browser you have used to perform the device login Return to the Azure Cloud Shell. If it shows the prompt again, you have successfully been signed in to your Microsoft 365 tenant and can now perform PnP PowerShell cmdlets like you're used to. Important There is one final important remark to make. When connecting using the -DeviceLogin option, PnP PowerShell cannot automatically switch to the yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com context, meaning any cmdlets you try to run that require being connected to the admin portal, will need you to use Connect-PnPOnline https://yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com -DeviceLogin yourself first to authenticate specifically to the admin site before you can use them. By using a Managed Identity Important The current versions of PnP PowerShell and Azure Cloud Shell do not support Managed Identity authentication. This is a known issue and we are working on a solution. In the meantime, you can use the Device Login option to authenticate to your Microsoft 365 environment."

    "keywords": "Using PnP PowerShell in Azure Functions In this article we will setup an Azure Function to use PnP PowerShell Important Notice that the Azure Function scripts in this article run in a separate thread/job. We do this because of possible conflicts between assemblies of already loaded PowerShell modules and PnP PowerShell (for instance, the Az cmdlets that get loaded by default use some of the same assemblies as PnP PowerShell but in different versions which can cause conflicts). By running the script in a separate thread we will not have these conflicts. If PnP PowerShell is the only module currently being used and loaded in your Azure Function you don't need the Start-ThreadJob construct and you can simply write the script as usual. Create the Azure Function App As the UI in the Azure Portal changes every now and then, but the principles stay the same, follow the following steps: Go to the Azure Portal and login with your Azure credentials Create a new Function App using the Create a resource button and searching for Function App or use this direct link to locate it Choose runtime stack PowerShell Core and version 7.4 (7.0 is not longer an option as of December 3rd, 2022) Select Windows as the operating system or else you will not be able to perform the following steps from your browser. Complete the creation of the Azure Function Once the resource has been created, click on Go to resource to open the Azure Function Configure the Azure Function Now your Azure Function has been created, proceed with the next paragraphs to configure it for using PnP PowerShell. Disable the Azure cmdlets in the Azure Function The Azure Function comes with the Azure cmdlets pre-installed. If you don't need them, you can disable them to save some memory and processing time. It will also avoid version conflicts with PnP PowerShell, so it is highly recommended to disable them. Navigate to App files which is located the left side menu of the function app under the Functions header. To disable the Az cmdlets, save and edit the profile.psd file. Mark out the following block in the file as follows, if not already done: # if ($env:MSI_SECRET) { # Disable-AzContextAutosave -Scope Process | Out-Null # Connect-AzAccount -Identity # } Save the profile.ps1 file. If you don't do this and enable a managed identity on the Azure Function, it will throw an exception. Make PnP PowerShell available to all functions in the Azure function App Navigate to App files which is located the left side menu of the function app under the Functions header. In the dropdown presented near the top, select requirements.psd1. You'll notice that the function app wants to provide the Azure cmdlets. If you do not need those, keep the Az entry presented commented out. Add a new entry or replace the whole contents of the file with one of the following and remember to save the requirements.psd1 file: Specific stable version Important PnP PowerShell version 2 or later is required for this to work @{ 'PnP.PowerShell' = '2.12.0' } The version that will be installed will be the specified specific build, which is generally recommended. You build and test your Azure Function against this specific PnP PowerShell version. Future releases may work differently and cause issues, therefore it is generally recommended to specify a specific version here. Latest stable version Important PnP PowerShell version 2 or later is required for this to work If, for some reason, you would like to ensure it is always using the latest available PnP PowerShell version, you can also specify a wildcard in the version (not recommended): @{ 'PnP.PowerShell' = '2.*' } This will then automatically download any minor version of the major 1 release when available. Note that wildcards will always take the latest stable version and not the nightly build/prerelease versions. Specific prerelease version If you wish to use a specific prerelease/nightly build version, go to the overview of available versions and literally copy/paste the version in the definition, i.e.: @{ 'PnP.PowerShell' = '2.99.50-nightly' } Decide how you want to authenticate in your Azure Function By using a Managed Identity The recommended option is to use a managed identity in Azure to allow your Azure Function to connect to Microsoft Graph or SharePoint Online using PnP PowerShell. Using this method, you specifically grant permissions for your Azure Function or Runbook to access these permissions, without having any client secret or certificate pair that potentially could fall into wrong hands. This makes this option the most secure option by far. Since version 1.11.95-nightly, Managed Identities are both supported against SharePoint Online as well as Microsoft Graph cmdlets. Before this version, only Microsoft Graph was being supported. Enabling the managed identity for an Azure Function In your Azure Function, in the left menu, go to Identity Ensure you are on the System assigned tab and flip the switch for Status to On Click the save button and confirm your action in the dialog box that will be shown A new entry will now automatically be created in your Azure Active Directory for this app having the same name as your Azure Function and the Object (principal) ID shown on this page. Take notice of the Object (principal) ID. We will need it in the next section to assign permissions to. Assigning permissions to the managed identity Next step is to assign permissions to this managed identity so it is authorized to access the Microsoft Graph and/or SharePoint Online. If you don't know which permissions exist yet, you can use the below sample to get a list of all available permissions: Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipal -BuiltInType MicrosoftGraph | Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAvailableAppRole Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipal -BuiltInType SharePointOnline | Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAvailableAppRole Once you know which permissions you would like to assign, you can use the below samples. Note that the Principal requires the object Id (not the application/client id) or the application name. Add-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAppRole -Principal \"62614f96-cb78-4534-bf12-1f6693e8237c\" -AppRole \"Group.Read.All\" -BuiltInType MicrosoftGraph Add-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAppRole -Principal \"mymanagedidentity\" -AppRole \"Sites.FullControl.All\" -BuiltInType SharePointOnline Create the Azure Function for managed identity authentication Create a new function and replace the function code with the following example: using namespace System.Net param($Request, $TriggerMetadata) Connect-PnPOnline -ManagedIdentity Get-PnPMicrosoft365Group Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{ StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK }) Notice the super clean and simple Connect-PnPOnline. Nothing that could fall into wrong hands, no client secret or certificate that could expire. Based on the permissions assigned to the managed identity, it will be able to authenticate and authorize access to the Microsoft Graph APIs used behind the cmdlet to fetch the data. By using a certificate Create your certificate In this following example we create a new Azure AD Application registration which creates your certificates. You can also use a private/public certificate key pair you already have. $password = Read-Host -Prompt \"Enter certificate password\" -AsSecureString Register-PnPEntraIDApp -ApplicationName \"MyDemoApp\" -Tenant [yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com] -CertificatePassword $password You will be asked to authenticate. Log in using an account that has the permissions to create an app registration in your Azure Active Directory. After logging in, the following actions will automatically be taken: An app registration will be created using the provided name A self signed certificate will be generated which includes a pfx and a cer file (private/public key pair) The public key of the certificate (cer) will be configured as a valid certificate to authenticate with for the app registration A basic set of permissions will be assigned to the app registration. These can freely be changed at will at a later time. Admin consent will be given to the given set of permissions Make a note of the clientid shown and proceed with the steps in the following section. Apply your certificate Once you have an Azure Active Directory application set up and the public key certificate uploaded to its registration, proceed with configuring the Azure Function to make use of the private key of this certificate pair: In your function app, navigate to Certificates under Settings, switch to the Bring your own certificates (.pfx) section and click on Add certificate. In the panel that appears from the side, select Upload certificate (.pfx) and select the \"MyDemoApp.pfx\" file that has been created for you in the Create your certificate step above. Enter the password you used when creating the certificate. The certificate friendly name can be anything you would like. After the certificate has been uploaded, copy the thumbprint value shown. Navigate to Configuration, ensure you are on the Application settings tab and click on New application setting Call the setting WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES and set the thumbprint as a value. To make all the certificates you uploaded available use * as the value. See https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate-in-code for more information. Click on OK at the bottom and then on Save at the top. Click Continue to confirm your changes. Create the Azure Function for certificate authentication Create a new function and replace the function code with the following example: using namespace System.Net # Input bindings are passed in via param block. param($Request, $TriggerMetadata) # Write to the Azure Functions log stream. Write-Host \"PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request.\" $script = { Connect-PnPOnline tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/demo -ClientId [the clientid created earlier] -Thumbprint [the thumbprint you copied] -Tenant [tenant.onmicrosoft.com] $web = Get-PnPWeb $web.Title } $webTitle = Start-ThreadJob -Script $script | Receive-Job -Wait $body = \"The title of the web is $($webTitle)\" # Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'. Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{ StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK Body = $body }) By using Credentials This method is not recommended as it requires you to have an account without MFA of which its credentials will be stored in Azure. Create your credentials Navigate to Configuration under Settings and create a new Application Setting. Enter tenant_user and enter the username you want to authenticate with as the user Enter tenant_pwd and enter the password you want to use for that user Create the function Create a new function and replace the function code with following example: using namespace System.Net # Input bindings are passed in via param block. param($Request, $TriggerMetadata) # Write to the Azure Functions log stream. Write-Host \"PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request.\" $script = { $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $env:tenant_pwd -AsPlainText -Force $credentials = New-Object PSCredential ($env:tenant_user, $securePassword) Connect-PnPOnline yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/demo -Credentials $credentials $web = Get-PnPWeb $web.Title } $webTitle = Start-ThreadJob -Script $script | Receive-Job -Wait $body = \"The title of the web is $($webTitle)\" # Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'. Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{ StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK Body = $body }) In the example above we are retrieving the username and password from the settings as environment variables. We then create a new credentials object which we pass in to the Connect-PnPOnline cmdlet. After connecting to SharePoint we output the title of the web through the function."

    "title": "Batching in PnP PowerShell | PnP PowerShell",
    "keywords": "Batching in PnP PowerShell Some cmdlets support batching, but there are a few things to point out here. Let me first explain the difference between a normal request and a batched request. Adding items without batching (CSOM) 1..100 | ForEach-Object{ Add-PnPListItem -List \"ItemTest\" -Values @{\"Title\" = \"Test Item $_\"} } If you add a list item with Add-PnPListItem without batching, the following happens behind the scenes: We retrieve the list and make sure we retrieve all the fields used in that list. (a least one request to the server but usually a few more CSOM requests) We add a new item to the list We loop through the values you specified to set on the item and depending on the type of field we format the value ready to be added to the item (this can introduce additional CSOM requests in the case of taxonomy fields for instance) We update the item (this will be a CSOM request to the server) All in all you see we make around 6 requests, although the exact number depends a bit on what type of fields you are setting. So if you loop through 100 items, you get at least 600 requests. Adding an item with batching (REST) $batch = New-PnPBatch 1..100 | ForEach-Object{ Add-PnPListItem -List \"ItemTest\" -Values @{\"Title\"=\"Test Item Batched $_\"} -Batch $batch } Invoke-PnPBatch -Batch $batch When you use batching, these number of requests are much lower. This is what happens when you use batching We retrieve the list and make sure we retrieve all the fields used in that list. We then, and that's important, add that list to a cache in the batch. That means that every subsequent request for the fields of that list will be coming from the cache. We loop through the values you specified to set on the item. This most of the time does not cause any additional request, with the exception of taxonomy fields. Due to limitations of the REST apis available to use we have to fallback to a CSOM request to format the value. We add the item with the new values to the list (creating a batched request) This means that for every new item there is one request + a few initial request to retrieve the list. Then when you execute Invoke-Batch we will check out how many items there are in the batch and will split them up accordingly to follow the request limits provided. You'll see that large batches are split up in chunks of 100 requests. This means that if you, say add 100 items, you will issue around 6 requests in total. Large batches and exceptions Depending on the type of requests you are making batches can be split up in 'chunks'. For instance, if the tasks you perform are towards SharePoint and behind the scenes use the REST api of SharePoint a batch larger then 100 requests will be split up in chunks of 100 requests. When behind the scenes the Microsoft Graph is being called then the batch requests will be split up in chunks of 20 requests. For instance, removing 520 list items will result in 6 separate requests, the first 5 containing 100 remove requests, the last one containing 20 remove requests. If during one of these chunks an exception occurs (for instance you are trying to delete an item that does not exist), by default we will continue processing the remaining batch chunks. If you want to stop processing these remaining batches immediately after an exception occurs, use the -StopOnException switch on Invoke-PnPBatch cmdlet. Cmdlets that support batching The following cmdlets support batching. (This support began with the 1.7.63-nightly release.)

To avoid having to add -ClientId on every connect, you can also perform the below task to set the default ClientId for your environment. This avoids you having to update all of your scripts to include -ClientId in the Connect-PnPOnline statements, making the impact of this change smaller by not having to update existing scripts. By storing a client id for a tenant Note This functionality is only available in the versions newer than 2.12.0 This options allows you to have different client ids for different tenant. To set this use the Set-PnPManagedAppId cmdlet. You do not have to be connected to a tenant for this. To set a client id for tenant with url https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com, you enter: Set-PnPManagedAppId -Url https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com -AppId f0e2b362-8973-4fc7-a293-3c73e2677e79 This will add an entry to your Windows Credential Manager or the MacOS keychain if your are on MacOS. Connect-PnPOnline will use this value to match the correct client id with the url you are connecting to and it is not needed use -ClientId anymore, e.g. Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com -Interactive You can manage entries using the Get-PnPManagedAppId and Remove-PnPManagedAppId cmdlets. Using these cmdlets it is possible to have different client/app ids for different tenants, which is usefull if you are a consultant serving multiple customers for instance. By setting an environment variable You can set an environment variable on your machine or in your profile to default to the ClientId you configure in it. The name of the environment variable should be either: ENTRAID_APP_ID, or ENTRAID_CLIENT_ID, or AZURE_CLIENT_ID. You only need one of these, not all of them.

    "title": "How to determine which permissions you need | PnP PowerShell",
    "keywords": "How to determine which permissions you need Note As of September 9th, 2024, it is required to use your own Entra ID Application Registration to use PnP PowerShell. This introduces the complexity of trying to determine the minimum set of permissions you will need to be able to execute your script. This article aims to help you in determining the permissions you need to set on your Entra ID Application Registration. Creating an Entra ID Application Registration In case you're starting from the beginning and you do not have your own Entra ID Application Registration yet to use with PnP Powershell, which is mandatory, you can follow these steps to create your Entra ID Application Registration. Starting with minimal permissions It is highly recommended to keep the permissions on your Entra ID Application Registration to a minimum to avoid risks when access through your application registration would somehow fall in the wrong hands. As PnP PowerShell always starts with connecting to SharePoint Online, you will at least need permissions to access SharePoint Online, regardless of whatever else you plan on doing with PnP PowerShell. When using a delegate login A delegate login means you will be interactively logging in to your tenant using PnP PowerShell by providing your credentials. There are several ways of connecting in this way. Always remember that in this scenario, regardless of which permissions you assign to your Entra ID Application Registration, the user logging in through PnP PowerShell must also have the permissions for whatever the user is trying to do. I.e. if you would assign AllSites.FullControl permissions on your application registration, the user still can only access those SharePoint Online sites to which the user has been granted permissions directly to that site as well and will only have those permissions assigned to it (i.e. read or write). The lowest permission you can set on a delegate login will be AllSites.Read on the delegate scope of SharePoint: When using an app only context An app only context is being used when your intend is to run a script that does not require any user intervention to connect and authenticate to your tenant. There are several ways of connecting in this way. In this scenario, exactly those permissions you assign to your Entra ID Application Registration are the ones the script that runs will have. Therefore, be extra careful in this scenario not to set too high permissions. The lowest permission you can set on an app only scenario will be Sites.Selected on the application scope of SharePoint: When using the Sites.Selected permission, you still must assign permissions to one or more sites where the script will have access to. Ensure you will assign at least Read permissions on the site of which you will use the URL in your Connect-PnPOnline <url> statement in your script. You can easily do so by utilizing the PnP PowerShell cmdlet Grant-PnPAzureADAppSitePermission as shown here: Grant-PnPAzureADAppSitePermission -AppId \"<Client ID of your Entra ID applicarion registration>\" -DisplayName \"PnP PowerShell\" -Permissions Read -Site <url of the SharePoint Online site to which you will connect> In order to be able to run this cmdlet, you will need to connect to PnP PowerShell using preferably another Entra ID application registration which will have the AllSites.FullControl permission on the delegate scope on SharePoint set to it and being logged on with a Global Administrator or SharePoint Administrator priviledged account. Adding additional permissions as needed Once you've se the minimum permissions as described above, you can go ahead and test using your Entra ID application registration to connect to SharePoint Online using one of the available connect options. You can add -ValidateConnection -Verbose to your Connect-PnPOnline cmdlet to instruct it to test the connection once established. Now you likely want to perform more than just a simple read using PnP PowerShell. Read on below to find out what you can do to find out about the additional permissions your application registration might need to operate correctly. When using a delegate login When planning to use your app registration for delegates, you could opt for simply starting to use it. Once you execute a cmdlet that requires more permissions, a dialog will pop up asking you to consent to these additional permissions being assigned to the application registration. An example of this is shown on the following screenshot: What technically happens here when you provide consent through this dialog is that in the Entra ID Enterprise Application connected to your Entra ID application registration, the permission gets added. This means that on subsequent requests of this cmdlet using this client id, even in new sessions, these permissions will then be granted already. You can visualize this by going to Entra ID > Identity > Applications > Enterprise applications and looking for the registration with the same name as your Entra ID application registration. Once found, open it, in the menu click on Permissions, go to the User consent tab and look at the assigned permissions: When using an app only context For an app only scenario, you will have to follow a different approach, as there is no way for it to interactively request for more permissions. If you try to execute a cmdlet for which the Entra ID application registration does not have permissions, it will return you an access denied notice. What you could try if you run into this, is to add -Verbose to your cmdlet. For many, but unfortunately not all, cmdlets, this will reveal which permissions it receives through the application registration and which permissions it actually needs to be able to execute properly. See the following example: In this scenario, you now know you need to add Application.Read.All on the applications scope of Microsoft Graph in your application registration in order to give it sufficient rights to execute this cmdlet. Help, I can't figure out which permissions I need As mentioned above, unfortunately, not for all cmdlets it will be clear which exact (minimum) permissions will be needed. Not even when using -Verbose. To give some guidance which permissions you could try for a minimum permissions approach, follow the table below. What are you trying to do Permission type Permission(s) likely needed from least to most priviledged Interact with SharePoint Delegate AllSites.Read / AllSites.Write / AllSites.Manage / AllSites.FullControl Interact with SharePoint App Only Sites.Selected / Sites.Read.All / Sites.ReadWrite.All / Sites.Manage.All / Sites.FullControl .All Interact with Microsoft Graph Delegate \\ App Only Use -Verbose or look at the documentation to find the permissions needed Interact with Power Platform Delegate Azure Service Management\\user_impersonation AND Dynamics CRM\\user_impersonation AND PowerApps Service\\User (the last one you can find on the second tab: APIs that my organization uses)"

    "keywords": "Using PnP PowerShell in Docker containers Using Docker allows you to use any software inside virtual environments, without having to install this software directly on your laptop or server. These virtual environments are containers, which might be imagined as lightweight virtual machines. Having their own virtual disks, memory and processes, containers are rationally isolated from your laptop operating system, providing you a great way of experimenting and using any version of PnP.PowerShell without installing it. The good news is that you will not even need to install PnP.PowerShell in containers by your own: PnP team is already publishing Docker container images for each supported and nightly release, here. You will however need to install docker runtime. If you use Windows, we would recommend you using Linux containers with help of WSL. Alternatively, even though it is not the most common way, you might want to run PnP.PowerShell in Windows containers. Mind you that some use cases might be limited when using Windows containers. If you use Mac OS or Linux, the easiest way is to use Linux containers. Play with PnP.PowerShell online You can try using m365pnp/powershell Docker containers online, without installing anything on your desktop/laptop. Open https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ Login Click Start Click + ADD NEW INSTANCE Run in the online console: docker run --rm -it m365pnp/powershell After that you can start running commands like Connect-PnPOnline. Installing Docker locally Mac OS: Install brew install --cask docker Launch Docker: Press ⌘ + Space to bring up Spotlight Search and enter Docker to launch Docker. In the Docker needs privileged access dialog box, click OK. Enter password and click OK. Linux: bash <(curl -s https://get.docker.com/) sudo usermod -aG docker $USER newgrp docker Linux containers on Windows (using WSL): Start installing WSL: Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName \"Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux\", \"VirtualMachinePlatform\" -NoRestart Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://wslstorestorage.blob.core.windows.net/wslblob/wsl_update_x64.msi -OutFile wsl_update_x64.msi -UseBasicParsing Start-Process msiexec.exe -Wait -ArgumentList \"/I $((Get-Location).Path)\\wsl_update_x64.msi /quiet\" Reboot the machine before you continue Finish installing WSL: wsl --set-default-version 2 wsl --install --distribution Ubuntu Install docker in WSL: bash <(curl -s https://get.docker.com/) sudo usermod -aG docker $USER newgrp docker Windows: iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1')) choco install -y docker-engine Using PnP.PowerShell Sometimes you want to run inline PnP.PowerShell commands. Latest stable version: docker run --rm -it m365pnp/powershell:latest Latest nightly version: docker run --rm -it m365pnp/powershell:nightly After that you can start running commands like Connect-PnPOnline. Mind you that in the case above, the container will have an isolated disk system so the commands that you run inside the container will not be able to access files from your host machine. However, sometimes you might want to run a script or use some files from your host OS (for example, when you have a ps1 file in a git repository that you cloned to your laptop). In this case you will need to mount a directory on your host as a volume inside the container. See the following examples. Linux/WSL/Mac OS: docker run --rm -it -v \"$(pwd):/home\" -w /home m365pnp/powershell Windows (run in PowerShell console): docker run --rm -it -v \"${pwd}:C:\\workplace\" -w C:\\workplace m365pnp/powershell In such container you can run Get-ChildItem and see the contents of the current directory. The examples above start new container and allow you to interactively use container, running inline commands. In other cases however, you might want to just start a container for a short time (a few seconds maybe) and run a ps1 script unattended and then automatically terminate the container. Here is how you can do it. Linux/WSL/Mac OS: docker run --rm -v \"$(pwd):/home\" -w /home m365pnp/powershell pwsh test.ps1 Windows (run in PowerShell console): docker run --rm -v \"${pwd}:C:\\workplace\" -w C:\\workplace m365pnp/powershell:1.10.0-nanoserver-1809 pwsh test.ps1 Finally, your scripts might have parametrization so that you can run the same code in different cases/environments. This is the way to provide variable values. Linux/WSL/Mac OS: ParameterValue=\"test\" docker run --rm -v \"$(pwd):/home\" -w /home m365pnp/powershell pwsh -c \"./test.ps1 -Parameter1 $ParameterValue\" Windows (run in PowerShell console): $ParameterValue=\"test\" docker run --rm -v \"${pwd}:C:\\workplace\" -w C:\\workplace m365pnp/powershell:1.10.0-nanoserver-1809 pwsh -c \"./test.ps1 -Parameter1 $ParameterValue\" Please see Docker documentation to see arguments for docker run command.

    "title": "Contribution guidance | PnP PowerShell",
    "keywords": "Contribution guidance Sharing is caring! All contributions to this repository are very welcome. This guidance should help you getting started contributing to PnP PowerShell by just following some easy steps. There are various ways to accomplish the same goal. We'll go through a process here that should be easy to follow and accomplish for anyone. If you prefer using other tools over the ones mentioned here, such as using the cloning feature within Visual Studio, of course, feel free to use that instead. Getting started Follow the paragraphs below to get yourself started with contributing to PnP PowerShell. Installing Git Tools We'll be using the command line Git Tools to complete the steps. If you prefer using other tools, such as Visual Studio or the desktop client of Git, feel free to use that instead. If you haven't got them already, install the Git Tools for your environment. They're available for Windows, Linux and Mac. Simply download the latest installer from: https://git-scm.com/downloads And click on the Click here to download link There will be a scary amount of questions asked during the installer. Just use all defaults and next-next-finish through the installation process Installing PowerShell 7 PnP PowerShell only runs on PowerShell 7. If you don't have it installed yet, follow the steps below to install it. If you already have it installed, you can skip to the next paragraph. Navigate to the PowerShell 7 download page and download the latest version of PowerShell 7. It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac. You can accept all the defaults and just do a next-next-finish installation. Installing the .NET SDK 8 To be able to compile the PnP PowerShell code, you need to have the .NET SDK 8 installed. If you don't have it installed yet, follow the steps below to install it. If you already have it installed, you can skip to the next paragraph. Navigate to the .NET SDK 8 download page and download the latest version of the .NET SDK 8. It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac. You can accept all the defaults and just do a next-next-finish installation. Create your own Fork To contribute to a GitHub project, what you do first, is create a thing called a fork. Basically it means you will get your own copy of the sourcecode. To do so, follow the steps below. Go to the PnP PowerShell repository on GitHub Make sure you're logged on to GitHub. If you dont have a GitHub account yet, create one and log on first before you continue. Click the Fork button in the top right corner of the page or use this direct link instead If it shows you a notice like this, you already have a fork. Continue with the next paragraph. If it instead shows something like this, click on Create fork to create your own fork. You can leave all the defaults. Updating your Fork Now that you have your own fork, you need to make sure it's up to date with the latest changes from the main repository. Do this every time before you start working on a change. If you don't do so, it will become much harder for us to review and merge your changes. To update your fork, follow the steps below. First identify if your fork is already up to date. If it is, it will show you a message like this and you're good to continue with the next paragraph. If it instead shows something like this, showing that you're a certain amount of commits behind on pnp:dev, you need to update your fork first by continueing with the next step. Click on the Sync fork button and in the flyout that appears click on Update branch It should now show the above message that your branch is up to date. You can now continue with the next paragraph. If it instead shows that you're a certain number of comits ahead, it means your dev branch got polluted by changes you have pushed to it and you need to reset it first. Read up under Troubleshooting for more information on how to resolve this situation. Cloning the repository to your local file system The next step is to download, or clone, your copy/fork of the repository to your local machine so you can work on updating it. Follow these steps to do so. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository to. For example, if you want to clone it to your C:\\Source folder, you would do the following: cd C:\\Source Look up the URL of your fork. You can find it by clicking on the Code button on your forked repository on GitHub In the command prompt or PowerShell window, type the following command and replace the URL with the URL of your fork: git clone <URL of repository> It may be that it asks you to log on to GitHub. If so, do so and it will continue with the clone. You should now have a copy of the PnP PowerShell code on your local machine in the subfolder named similarly to your fork name, typically powershell. If you want to read up on an explanation what each of these folders are for, read the folder structure article. Add a reference to the upstream repository. This will allow you to pull in changes from the main repository to your local copy. To do so, type the command below. This time you can execute it exactly as shown here, you don't need to replace it with the URL of your own repository. git remote add upstream https://github.com/pnp/powershell.git You can validate if the upstream has been added successfully by executing: git remote -v If it shows entries for upstream, it worked. Making changes to the code You are now ready to start making changes to the code! Use your favorite code editor to make changes to the code. If you don't have a favorite code editor yet, we recommend you use Visual Studio Code. It's free, open source and cross platform. It's also the editor some of us use ourselves. You can also use the full version of Visual Studio. The next steps will assume Visual Studio Code has been installed and will be used. Open Visual Studio Code and using the File menu go to Open Folder... Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository to and select the folder named powershell. Click Select Folder to open the folder in Visual Studio Code. If a dialog pops up asking if you trust the authors of the files in the folder, click Yes, I trust the authors. Before starting to make changes, to avoid polution your dev branch as it needs to stay up to date with the PnP PowerShell dev branch, create a new branch for your changes. To do so, click on dev at the bottom left and in the flyout menu that appears on the top, click on Create new branch... Enter any name for the new branch you would like. It helps giving it a distinctive name that makes it easy to identify the changes you're making. For example, if you're going to be working on a new cmdlet which allows to retrieve sites, you could name it RetrieveFilesCmdlet. Hit enter to create the new branch. At the bottom left of Visual Studio Code, it should now show the new branch name you have created. You're now good to go and start making your changes to the code. Once you're done making your changes, proceed with the next paragraph on how to test your changes. Some hints on how to work with Visual Studio Code to find the files in PnP PowerShell more easily: Use CTRL+P to easily search for existing files. If you're looking for an existing cmdlet to update, you can type its name without -PnP to find it easily. I.e. for Get-PnPSite, type GetSite and it will show you the file where the cmdlet is defined. You can then open that file by hitting enter and make your changes. You can also use CTRL+P to easily search for existing documentation on cmdlets. This time you will enter the full cmdlet name to find the documentation. I.e. for Get-PnPSite, type Get-PnPSite and it will show you the file where the documentation for the cmdlet is defined. You can then open that file by hitting enter and make your changes. Its easier to copy than to reinvent! If you're going to add a new cmdlet, look for one that does something close to what you want to do and make a copy of it to function as a starter. You can then rename the cmdlet and update the code to do what you want it to do. Please only submit one (type of) change per pull request. If you want to submit multiple changes, please submit them as separate pull requests. This makes it easier for us to review, understand and merge your changes. Testing your changes If you have only updated documentation, so called .md files, there's no need to test your changes. Just read up on your changes once more to ensure there are no typos. If you have updated code, you need to test your changes to make sure they work as expected. To do so, you need to build the code and then test your changes. Follow these steps to do so. Ensure you do not have any PowerShell window open on your machine in which you have loaded PnP PowerShell. If you do, close them all before proceeding. In Visual Studio Code, hit CTRL+SHIFT+B to open the build menu. In the menu that appears on the top, choose the option Build with nugets. In the terminal window that appears at the bottom, you should see the build process start. It might take a few minutes to complete. Once it's done, you should see a message that the build succeeded. Be sure that it shows Build succeeded and no errors around copying the files to your local PowerShell modules folder. If it instead shows an error like the one below, it means you still have a PowerShell session open somewhere your machine which has PnP PowerShell loaded and which blocks the build process to update the files. It can be frustrating at times to find the PowerShell session that is blocking the build process. If you're not sure which session is blocking the build process, you can try to close all PowerShell sessions and try again. If that doesn't work, you can try restarting Visual Studio Code. If it you get the error \"Path to shell executable \"pwsh.exe\" does not exist\", open tasks.json file and change executable path \"pwsh.exe\" to the full path of your \"C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\pwsh.exe\". You can now use PnP PowerShell as normal, but this time it will use your own build instead of the official PnP PowerShell build. To test your changes, you can use the cmdlets you have created or updated. Ensure you will use a PowerShell 7 session and not a PowerShell 5 session. If you wish to step through your code debugging it, in your PowerShell 7 window, type the following command to reveal the process ID it runs under: $PID Back in Visual Studio Code, hit F5 If it asks you to install the coreclr component, follow these steps. In Visual Studio Code, at the top a flyout menu should appear with the currently running processes on your machine. Start typing in the process ID you revealed in the step above and select the process that matches your PowerShell 7 session. Note that this does not work if you have installed PowerShell 7 through the Microsoft Store. If that's the case, uninstall it again from your Windows start menu by right clicking on PowerShell 7 and choosing Uninstall and reinstall PowerShell 7 using any of the other options. You can now set breakpoints as you are used to in your code and use the PowerShell 7 session you connected to to run the cmdlet and hit the breakpoints you have set. Submitting your changes for review Once you're done making and testing your changes, you need to submit them for review and submission in what we call a Pull Request, or PR in short. Follow these steps to do so. Within Visual Studio Code, go to the Source Control section on the left. You will see all of the changes you have made. Once again, ensure with the branch name at the bottom, in this case MyAwesomeUpdate that you are working off of your own branch and not the dev branch. Enter a meaningful commit message in which you very briefly describe what you have changed. Then click the Commit button to commit your changes. If Visual Studio Code shows a dialog mentioning that there are no staged changes to commit, just proceed by clicking Yes or Always based on your personal preference. If Visual Studio Code shows a dialog mentioning Make sure you configure your \"user.name\" and \"user.email\" in git., follow these steps. Now click the Publish Branch option that should appear under the Source Control section of Visual Studio Code to push your branch to GitHub. If it asks for the remote to publish it to, pick Origin. Open your browser and go to the PnP PowerShell repository on GitHub. You should see a message that you have pushed a new branch to your fork. Click the Compare & pull request button to proceed. Provide a meaningful title for your pull request and a description that explains what you have changed and why. Then click the Create pull request button. Please ensure you leave the Allow edits from maintainers option checked so we can provide you with feedback on your pull request. Your pull request has now been created! Please be patient while someone from the PnP PowerShell team will review your suggested changes and potentially provide you with feedback. This may take some time, as all of us are doing this in our spare time. Thanks for contributing! Troubleshooting My local fork is ahead of pnp:dev First proceed with the steps in the Cloning the repository to your local file system section to make sure you have a local copy of your version of the code. After you've set up a local copy of the code, in a command prompt or PowerShell window, navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository to and execute the following command: git fetch upstream Now execute the following command to reset your local dev branch to the upstream dev branch: git checkout dev git reset --hard upstream/dev git push origin dev --force If you now return to GitHub in your webbrowser into your own fork, it should show that your dev branch is up to date with the upstream dev branch. How do I build against a local version of PnP Core and/or PnP Framework? If your change also requires updates to PnP Core and/or PnP Framework, you need to build PnP PowerShell against your locally built version of PnP Core and/or PnP Framework. To do so, follow the steps in this article. If your changes just require updates to PnP PowerShell, you don't need to do this and can just follow the steps outlined on this page. Visual Studio Code shows a dialog mentioning Make sure you configure your \"user.name\" and \"user.email\" in git. If Visual Studio Code shows a dialog mentioning Make sure you configure your \"user.name\" and \"user.email\" in git., click Cancel in that dialog and open a PowerShell 7 window and execute the following commands, replacing the values with your information: git config --global user.name \"John Doe\" git config --global user.email \"johndoe@outlook.com\" You only need to do this once on your machine. Visual Studio shows a dialog asking to install the coreclr component If Visual Studio Code asks you to install the coreclr component, click Cancel as it won't work trying to install from that dialog. Instead go to the extensions tab on the left in Visual Studio, use the search box to search for c#, click on the result that states C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp) and then click Install. How do I know the process ID to attach to for debugging? If you wish to step through your code debugging it, in your PowerShell 7 window, type the following command to reveal the process ID it runs under: $PID Alternatively, if you wish the process ID to be shown in the title of the window to make it a little easier to find the process ID, in a PowerShell 7 window, type the following command: notepad $profile If it states it cannot find the file and asks you if it should create a new file, answer with Yes. In the profile file, add the following line: $Host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = \"[PID: $PID] : PowerShell $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion)\" Save notepad and open a new PowerShell 7 window. It should now show the process ID in the title of the window."

    "title": "How to handle authenticating to multiple tenants | PnP PowerShell",
    "keywords": "How to handle authenticating to multiple tenants One question that may come up when working with multiple tenants is how to handle authenticating to multiple tenants, especially since we now require you to register your own Entra ID Application Registration. This is a common scenario when you have a separate development, test and production tenant setup. Or if you are working with multiple customers' tenants. This can be challenging because each tenant requires its own application registration, having it's own application ID / Client ID and may have different authentication requirements, such as different identity providers or different authentication mechanisms. In this article, we will try to inspire you on some methods you could apply to handle authenticating to multiple tenants in more convient ways. How could this be a challenge? One might wonder why this could even be a challenge. After all, you could just create an application registration in each tenant and use the corresponding application ID / Client ID when authenticating. Let's suppose you do so and say we have created these: Client ID Tenant Purpose 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 contosodev.onmicrosoft.com Development Tenant 23456789-2345-2345-2345-234567890123 contosotest.onmicrosoft.com Test Tenant 34567890-3456-3456-3456-345678901234 contoso.onmicrosoft.com Production Tenant You now have multiple application registrations, each with its own application ID / Client ID. This means you need to keep track of all these application IDs / Client IDs and use the correct one when authenticating. This can be cumbersome and error-prone, especially if you have many tenants. When connecting to one of these tenants, you will need to connect like this: Connect-PnPOnline contosodev.sharepoint.com -Interactive -ClientId 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 Connect-PnPOnline contosotest.sharepoint.com -Interactive -ClientId 23456789-2345-2345-2345-234567890123 Connect-PnPOnline contoso.sharepoint.com -Interactive -ClientId 34567890-3456-3456-3456-345678901234 This could lead to mistakes, such as using the wrong application ID / Client ID when connecting to a tenant. This could lead to authentication errors, which might lead to confusion and frustration. Idea 1: Create your own function to encapsulate the connection logic One option is to create your on functions which allow you to connect a specific environment and have the function pass in the required parameters for connecting to it, such as the ClientId and the Certificate to use. You could easily establish this by opening PowerShell 7 and executing: Windows notepad $profile Linux/Mac vi $profile Add to your profile functions, such as: Function Connect-PnPDevTenant { Connect-PnPOnline https://contosodev.sharepoint.com -ClientId 12345678-1234-1234-1234-123456789012 } Function Connect-PnPProdTenant { Connect-PnPOnline https://contoso.sharepoint.com -ClientId 34567890-3456-3456-3456-345678901234 } Save the file and start a new PowerShell 7 session to have the updated profile being loaded into the session. Now you can simply connect to your tenant by executing: Connect-PnPDevTenant And it will execute the cmdlet as configured in your profile instead. Idea 2: Create your own multi tenant application registration When you create an Entra ID Application registration, either manually or using PnP PowerShell, you can configure or switch it to be used on multiple tenants. If the Entra ID Application registration has already been created: Go to https://entra.microsoft.com In the menu on the left, expand Identity > Applications and click on App registrations Locate the Entra ID Application registration you wish to switch to become a multi tenant application registration Go to Authentication Under \"Supported account types\", select \"Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Microsoft Entra ID tenant - Multitenant)\" and click on Save at the bottom You can now use the Client ID of this application with any tenant. Restrictions may apply, based on the specific configuration of the tenants you wish to use it against. Idea 3: Utilize the credential manager to store your client IDs See this article on how to use the Credential Manager with PnP PowerShell. Idea 4: Use persisted logins See this article on how to use the persisted login feature that has been added in PnP PowerShell version 3. Other ideas? If you have any other idea to easily work with multiple tenants, feel free to edit this article, add your ideas, and submit it through a Pull Request."

    "keywords": "Using PnP PowerShell with Microsoft Search Note On August 18th, 2024, Microsoft has announced through Message Center Announcement MC865187 that it will no longer charge extra for adding items to the Microsoft Search index. 50 million items can be added to the Microsoft Search index for free on any tenant having at least one of these licenses: Office 365 E1, Office 365 E3, Office 365 E5, Microsoft 365 E3, Microsoft 365 E5, Microsoft 365 F1, Microsoft 365 F3, Office 365 F3, Microsoft 365 Business Basic, Microsoft 365 Business Standard, Microsoft 365 Business Premium, Office 365 G1, Office 365 G3, Office 365 G5, Microsoft 365 G3, Microsoft 365 G5, Office 365 A3, Office 365 A5, Microsoft 365 A3, Microsoft 365 A5. More about this in this blogpost. Adding your own content to the Microsoft Search index can be a very interesting option for a lot of organizations. Ingesting content coming from other applications used within the organization allows for one search engine, Microsoft Search, to return results even beyond the Microsoft landscape scope. Users will no longer have to consult several search engines or will have to think where they would be able to find the content they look for. Instead, the search results will point them to where they can find it, regardless of the source it can be found in. Tip Optionally combine this with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 and leverage the full strength of AI that \"knows\" about your organizational data and is able to answer questions from employees in natural language, saving a lot of valuable time for not having to search for exact phrases that exist in indexed content. Which content can I add to the Microsoft Search Index First, think of which data in your organization could be useful to add to the Microsoft Search index. Examples could be your corporate intranet, if it doesn't run on SharePoint Online, documentation sites, archives, databases, fileshares, non-Microsoft cloud storage platforms, helpdesk ticketing systems or more. It does not even have to be content that can directly be linked to, but rather could be informational to people looking for it. As long as you have a way to access the data in the system you want to index, PnP PowerShell can assist you in easily adding this content to the Microsoft Search index. Where do I start After defining one or more content sources you would like to add to the Microsoft Search Index, first check if there is an existing connector for that content source already. After all, there's no need to reinvent the wheel. Microsoft has created and is offering connectors to various popular platforms for free. You can find them here. Next to that, Microsoft partners have also created over 100 connectors that can be used. Sometimes against a fee. Check this page to see which ones are available. If the content source you want to index does not have a connector yet, or for some reason the connector offered doesn't exactly do what you want it to do, you can also easily add the content to the Microsoft Search Index yourself, using PnP PowerShell. How can I leverage PnP PowerShell to get my content into the Microsoft Search Index PnP PowerShell can play a great role in adding your organization's content to the Microsoft Search index. Setting this up can be accomplished well under 30 minutes. Just follow the steps below to make it happen. Warning You need to have the Search Administrator or Global Administrator role to perform the following tasks. Step 1: Creating a new custom connector In this step we're going to create a new custom connector. A custom connector is going to represent the data source we're going to ingest items from into the Microsoft Search Index. Although the web interface of the Microsoft 365 Admin Center has an option to create a new Custom connector, it cannot be used for this purpose. Instead, we'll use PnP PowerShell to create our custom connector. Open a new PowerShell 7 session and connect to your tenant using an account that has the Search Administrator or Global Administrator role Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -Interactive -ClientId <client id of your Entra ID Application Registration> Use the New-PnPSearchExternalConnection cmdlet to create the new custom connector to your data. Be sure to replace the identity, name and description values with something meaningful that indicates the source of the data you're going to add to the index. New-PnPSearchExternalConnection -Identity \"mycustomdatasource\" -Name \"My custom data source\" -Description \"External content ingested using PnP PowerShell\" You can optionally validate that the custom connector has been created by going to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center > Settings > Search & intelligence > Data sources (direct link) where it should now show up. Step 2: Creating a search schema The second step consists out of creating a search schema for your custom connector. The search schema simply tells Microsoft Search what kind of data it can expect and through which of this data it can search to look for matches to what end users will be searching for. I.e. will it have a title, description, person last modifying the content, priority, or other fields. This is totally up to you to define based on what makes sense with regards to the data source you're going to be indexing from. In the PowerShell session we still have open from the first step, we're going to use the Set-PnPSearchExternalSchema cmdlet to create the schema. If you later on want to update it, you can use the same cmdlet with the same parameters, hence the Set verb and not the New verb being used. The schema in the below sample is defined as JSON in text, so you can easily modify it to match your scenario. Ensure that the name for ConnectionId matches with the value you have used for Identity when creating the connection. Set-PnPSearchExternalSchema -ConnectionId \"mycustomdatasource\" -SchemaAsText '{ \"baseType\": \"microsoft.graph.externalItem\", \"properties\": [ { \"name\": \"title\", \"type\": \"String\", \"isSearchable\": \"true\", \"isRetrievable\": \"true\", \"labels\": [ \"title\" ] }, { \"name\": \"url\", \"type\": \"String\", \"isSearchable\": \"false\", \"isRetrievable\": \"true\", \"labels\": [ \"url\" ] }, { \"name\": \"iconUrl\", \"type\": \"String\", \"isSearchable\": \"false\", \"isRetrievable\": \"true\", \"labels\": [ \"iconUrl\" ] }, { \"name\": \"description\", \"type\": \"String\", \"isSearchable\": \"true\", \"isRetrievable\": \"true\" } ] }' -Wait In this JSON schema you will notice isSearchable and isRetrievable. The first means that Microsoft Search is allowed to use the content provided in that field to look for a match with what the user is searching for. The latter means the value of this field will be returned in the search results and can be used to display it to the user in the search results. The script will wait and validate if the schema change has been applied and return to the prompt when it's ready to be used. If you don't want to wait and just let it create or update the schema in the background, remove the -Wait parameter. If you receive a response stating \"The specified resource name already exists\", it means that the connector is currently still busy updating its schema from a previous instruction. Wait a couple of minutes and try it again. You can optionally validate that the custom connector has recieved a schema by going to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center > Settings > Search & intelligence > Data sources (direct link) where it should show a Connection state of Ready to indicate that it's ready to receive ingested items. It may take 10 minutes or more for it to reach the Ready state. If it's showing the Connection state Preparing to sync, it means it is still applying the schema. Step 3: Configure where your search results should be shown Ingesting items into the Microsoft Search index will only prove to be useful if they show up somewhere in search results. In this step we're going to take care of that. For this you have two options: have the results show up under the All vertical along with all the other items it matches with or give the results its own so called vertical. The latter means it will have its own tab in Microsoft 365 Search and only when clicked on that tab, it will show results from this source and this source only, so not mixed up with other results from other sources it may find. Tip Once the schema has been defined and the data is starting to show up in the Microsoft Search index, you have a choice to make on how you want to show the results. One option is to read on and follow the steps below to surface the results in the out of the box search. Another option is to use PnP Modern Search, which allows you to show the results in a SharePoint Online search results page or in Microsoft Teams. It is absolutely possible to use both PnP Modern Search and standard Microsoft Search at the same time. PnP Modern Search will provide you with a lot more flexibility in how you want to show the results, including custom display templates, custom refiners, custom sorting options, and more. If you decide to go with the results showing up in the All tab, so along with results from other sources, simply go to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center > Settings > Search & intelligence > Data sources (direct link) and click on the link next to your custom connector that reads Include Connector Results. Important If you want your ingested search items to be shown in Microsoft 365 Copilot results, at present you must add your content to the All vertical, or else Copilot will be unable to find your content. In the popup that appears after doing so, click OK to confirm having items from this index show up in the All tab. If you decide to (also?) give it its own tab in the Microsoft 365 Search instead, navigate to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center > Settings > Search & intelligence > Customizations > Verticals (direct link). Click on + Add Enter the Name you would like to show up as the tab in Microsoft 365 Search for this source and click Next Click on Connectors to expand the list with available connectors Check the box in front of the connector you have created in step 1 above. Click Next to continue. The Add a query step you can skip by clicking on Next at the bottom. The Filters step you can also skip by clicking on Next at the bottom. Click on Add Vertical at the bottom of the Review the vertical settings step to continue once again. Click on Enable vertical to enable it. Once it's done spinning, click on Done at the bottom to finalize adding the vertical. It may take up to an hour before the vertical/tab starts showing up in the Microsoft 365 Search results. To validate if the vertical has been added, go to https://www.microsoft365.com/search and check if it shows a tab with the name you have used to create the vertical in this step at the top of the search results. Step 4: Configure how the search results should be shown You can define how the items coming from your custom source will be shown in the Microsoft 365 Search results. In this step we will take care of this. In some scenarios you could skip this entire step and let it try to render the results using a default visualization. In some scenarios however you will notice that it will show an error when it tries to render the results coming from your indexed items. To play on the safe side, it is recommended to always provide your custom display template that it can use to render the results. Navigate to the Microsoft 365 Admin Center > Settings > Search & intelligence > Customizations > Result types (direct link). Click on + Add to add a new result type Provide any Name you would like for the result type and click Next at the bottom. At the Select a content source step, select the content source you have added in step 1 and click Next at the bottom. Skip the Set rules for the result type step by clicking Next at the bottom. In the Design your layout step, notice the properties shown at the bottom of this step under Available properties and click on the Launch Layout Designer button. In the Search Layout designer website that opens, pick a design that you like best for rendering the search results coming from your custom connector, i.e. the first one, and click Get Started at the bottom. Click on each element in the visual sample of the search result and ensure that each element gets a property mapping. You can find which ones you can use back in the wizard we just came from, under the Available properties section. Just type over the name of the property you would like to link to each element in the result. If there's an element in the result you don't want to map or use, you must delete it by clicking on the Edit layout button at the top, selecting the element to remove, and clicking on the circle with the X next to it to remove it. Only after you provided a property mapping for each of the elements, the Create layout button at the bottom will become available and you can continue by clicking on that button. Click on Okay in the dialog that will show to confirm. Return back to your browser tab with the Design your layout step in the wizard. Paste the contents of your clipboard (CTRL+V) into the Paste the JSON script that you created with Layout Designer field and click Next at the bottom. Alternatively, if you're having problems creating your own design layout, if you stuck with the samples used above, you can use this schema which maps all the fields used in the sample above to the layout: { \"type\": \"AdaptiveCard\", \"version\": \"1.3\", \"body\": [ { \"type\": \"ColumnSet\", \"columns\": [ { \"type\": \"Column\", \"width\": \"auto\", \"items\": [ { \"type\": \"Image\", \"url\": \"${iconUrl}\", \"horizontalAlignment\": \"Center\", \"size\": \"Small\" } ], \"horizontalAlignment\": \"Center\" }, { \"type\": \"Column\", \"width\": \"stretch\", \"items\": [ { \"type\": \"ColumnSet\", \"columns\": [ { \"type\": \"Column\", \"width\": \"auto\", \"items\": [ { \"type\": \"TextBlock\", \"text\": \"[${title}](${url})\", \"weight\": \"Bolder\", \"size\": \"Medium\", \"maxLines\": 3, \"color\": \"Accent\" } ], \"spacing\": \"None\" } ], \"spacing\": \"Small\" }, { \"type\": \"TextBlock\", \"text\": \"[${url}](${url})\", \"spacing\": \"Small\", \"weight\": \"Bolder\", \"color\": \"Dark\" }, { \"type\": \"TextBlock\", \"text\": \"${description}\", \"maxLines\": 2, \"wrap\": true, \"spacing\": \"Small\" } ], \"spacing\": \"Medium\" } ] } ], \"$schema\": \"http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json\", \"$data\": {} } Click on Add result type at the bottom Click on Done on the Your result type is added page to complete this step. Step 5: Ingesting content into Microsoft 365 Search Now we're finally ready to start ingesting our content into the Microsoft 365 Search index. How or where you get the actual content from varies largely on the system you wish to pull the data from and is therefore out of scope of this article. Once you have the content, you can create new items into the Microsoft 365 Search Index by executing the cmdlet Set-PnPSearchExternalItem: Set-PnPSearchExternalItem -ConnectionId \"mycustomdatasource\" -ItemId \"1\" -Properties @{ \"title\"=\"Test of this PnP PowerShell Connector\"; \"description\"=\"This is a sample item\"; \"url\"=\"https://microsoft.com/articlexyz\"; \"iconUrl\"=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pnp/media/40e7cd8952a9347ea44e5572bb0e49622a102a12/parker/ms/300w/parker-ms-300.png\" } -ContentValue \"This is sample content that will be indexed. By searching for something that appears in this content, it should be returned by Microsoft 365 Search.\" -ContentType Text -GrantEveryone Few things to notice with this cmdlet: Ensure the -ConnectionId matches the -Identity name you have used for your custom connector in step 1. The -ItemId is unique for this result. You can pick whatever you wish, but you need this exact same Id again to update or remove this result. At present, there is no cmdlet or API to retrieve all Ids of all items that are in the Microsoft 365 Search index already, so you may even want to keep a record of this somewhere yourself. The Properties match with the property names you have used in the schema in step 2. These values are mapped to the elemets you defined in step 4. The ContentValue is the content of the item you are indexing. Microsoft Search uses this content to try to match this as a result when searching for something. It will take up to an hour before ingested items will start to appear in search or Copilot results. Be patient. You can restrict who can see the result with the grant options. Check the documentation of the cmdlet for all possibilities. This sample sets it so that any user in the tenant can see the result. The end result After giving it some time to process and index the content you have ingested, depending on the options you have chosen above, you will see the results popping up in the All vertical, designated vertical and in Microsoft 365 Copilot. What's next Once you have the basics in place, give it some time to index and content to start showing up in Microsoft Search and Microsoft Copilot. It typically should not take more than a few hours and very likely will take much less for it to appear. Once you have items in your index, you can utilize PnP PowerShell to see all the items you have indexed using Get-PnPSearchExternalItem and use Remove-PnPSearchExternalItem to remove specific items from the index. It's up to you to define the content freshness by utilizing the Set-PnPSearchExternalItem cmdlet to add new or update existing items as often as you would like to. Can be for example every hour, every day, every month or at any interval you think makes sense for your use case. It's totally up to you to ensure the index stays actual and correct."

    "href": "articles/permissionattributes.html",
    "title": "Working with permission attributes | PnP PowerShell",
    "keywords": "Working with permission attributes All cmdlet classes in code can be decorated with permission attributes. These attributes are used to define the permissions required to run the cmdlet. The permissions are checked before the cmdlet is executed. If the user does not have the required permissions, the cmdlet will throw a warning. It will still attempt to execute the cmdlet, but it will not be able to complete the operation if the user does not have the required permissions. This has been done in case the permissions defined in the attribute are not accurate, so that it will still work. Types of permissions that can be used in the permission attributes are: ApiNotAvailableUnderApplicationPermissions ApiNotAvailableUnderDelegatedPermissions RequiredApiApplicationPermissions RequiredApiDelegatedPermissions RequiredApiDelegatedOrApplicationPermissions The attributes can be applied to the cmdlet class. The RequiredApi attributes take a string array as a parameter. The string array contains the permissions required to run the cmdlet. The permissions are defined in the format resource/scope. The resource is the resource that the permission is required for, and the permission is the permission that is required. You can use the below table to find the supported resources you can use and what they map to in an Entra ID Application Registration: Resource Entra ID API permission Microsoft APIs APIs my organization uses sharepoint SharePoint X graph Microsoft Graph X exchangeonline Office 365 Exchange Online X azure Azure Service Management X flow Power Automate X powerapps PowerApps Service X dynamics Dynamics CRM X You can combine multiple permissions in the same attribute. They can be from the same resource or from different resources. The syntax how to apply them would be like: [RequiredApiApplicationPermissions(\"sharepoint/Sites.Read.All\", \"graph/Group.Read.All\")] This sample would require both the Sites.Read.All on SharePoint and the Group.Read.All on Microsoft Graph permissions to be present in the application registration under the application permissions type. If multiple attributes are defined on a cmdlet, the cmdlet will require only one of the permissions defined in the attributes to run. They are treated as an OR condition towards eachother. I.e. the following permission attributes would define that only one of the permissions is required to run the cmdlet: [RequiredApiDelegatedOrApplicationPermissions(\"graph/GroupMember.Read.All\")] [RequiredApiDelegatedOrApplicationPermissions(\"graph/Group.Read.All\")] [RequiredApiDelegatedOrApplicationPermissions(\"graph/Directory.Read.All\")] [RequiredApiDelegatedOrApplicationPermissions(\"graph/Group.ReadWrite.All\")] [RequiredApiDelegatedOrApplicationPermissions(\"graph/Directory.ReadWrite.All\")] These attributes should be added starting with the least priviledged one at the top going down towards the most priviledged permission. If you have a scenario that a combination of permissions is required, you can define multiple permissions in the same attribute to have them be handled as an AND. I.e. the following permission attributes would define that all of the permissions are required to run the cmdlet: [RequiredApiDelegatedOrApplicationPermissions(\"graph/GroupMember.Read.All\", \"graph/Group.Read.All\")] ApiNotAvailableUnderApplicationPermissions This attribute indicates that the cmdlet cannot be run in the context of an application. If the cmdlet is run in the context of an application, a warning will be thrown. Sample of where application permissions are not allowed: Sample of how the attribute can be applied: ApiNotAvailableUnderDelegatedPermissions This attribute indicates that the cmdlet cannot be run in the delegated context. If the cmdlet is run in a delegated context, a warning will be thrown. RequiredApiApplicationPermissions This attribute indicates that the cmdlet requires specific application permissions to run. If the application does not have the required permissions, a warning will be thrown. Sample of how the attribute can be applied: RequiredApiDelegatedPermissions This attribute indicates that the cmdlet requires specific delegated permissions to run. If the delegate does not have the required permissions, a warning will be thrown. Sample of how the attribute can be applied: RequiredApiDelegatedOrApplicationPermissions This attribute indicates that the cmdlet requires specific permissions to run, which are the same for a delegate and an application context. If the delegate or application does not have the required permissions, a warning will be thrown. Sample of how the attribute can be applied:"

    "href": "articles/persistedlogin.html",
    "title": "Persisted Login | PnP PowerShell",
    "keywords": "Persisted Login Starting with PnP PowerShell 3.0, the Connect-PnPOnline cmdlet has been updated to allow -PersistLogin to be provided. Documentation for it can be found here. This parameter allows you to persist the delegated authentication token retrieved through an interactive login in a local file on your machine, which can be used for subsequent connections without requiring re-authentication. This feature is particularly useful for scenarios where you need to run scripts or tasks that require authentication but do not want to enter your credentials every time. The risk obviously will be that anyone with access to your machine can use the token to authenticate against your tenant. Where is the token stored The token is stored in a file in the %LOCALAPPDATA%\\.m365pnppowershell folder on Windows or $HOME/.m365pnppowershell on Linux and MacOS. The file is encrypted using the Data Protection API (DPAPI) on Windows or the Keychain on MacOS and Linux. This means that the token is securely stored and cannot be easily accessed by unauthorized users nor can it be copied to another machine as the encryption is tied to the machine on which it has been generated. However, it is important to note that if you share your machine with others, they may be able to access the token if they have access to your user profile. How does it work When you use the -PersistLogin parameter with the Connect-PnPOnline cmdlet, PnP PowerShell will authenticate you as normal but will also store the refresh token in a local file. The next time you run Connect-PnPOnline, PnP PowerShell will check if a valid token already exists in the local file for the tenant or site you are trying to connect to. If a valid token is found, it will be used to authenticate without prompting for credentials. If no valid token is found, PnP PowerShell will prompt for credentials as normal. You do not need to specify the -PersistLogin parameter again for subsequent connections unless you want to change the behavior. Clearing the persisted login If you want to clear the persisted login and remove the stored token, you can connect to the tenant for which you would like to remove the stored token first and then use the Disconnect-PnPOnline cmdlet with the -ClearPersistedLogin option. Documentation for it can be found here. This will delete the token from the local file and require you to authenticate again the next time you run Connect-PnPOnline. FAQ Can I use -PersistLogin in Azure? No you cannot, as there are no profiles folders in Azure. Can I use -PersistLogin with an app only context? No, it is meant to be used for an interactive delegated authentication context only. If you want to use an app only context, you can just use the parameters with the Connect-PnPOnline cmdlet that support app only authentication as normal. Documentation for it can be found here. Do I still need my own application registration in Entra ID when using -PersistLogin? Yes, this is still required. Can I use a different application registration for -PersistLogin for different tenants or even site collections on the same tenant? Yes, that is supported. Just use it as described above and it will store the token for the tenant or site collection you are connecting to."

    "title": "Register an Entra ID Application to use with PnP PowerShell | PnP PowerShell",
    "keywords": "Register an Entra ID Application to use with PnP PowerShell Note It has always been a recommended practice to register your own Entra ID Application to use with PnP PowerShell. As of September 9th, 2024, this has become mandatory step. This article will guide you through how to do so. The first decision you will have to make is whether you are going to interactively log on through PnP PowerShell to your tenant by providing your credentials, Interactive Login, or if you are aiming to write a script that will log on without requiring any user intervention, App Only Access. Depending on your scenario, continue reading in the appropriate section below. Setting up access to your own Entra ID App for Interactive Login In this scenario, you will be creating an application registration in Entra ID which will allow you to interactively log on to your tenant using PnP PowerShell. This means that each time you use PnP PowerShell, you will need to enter your credentials and comply with any multi factor authentication and conditional access policies that may have been set up on your tenant. There are two methods to create your application registration for this scenario: creating it automatically (easiest) or creating it manually. Both will require you to have at least the Application Developer permission role or the Global Administrator permission role. The first should be enough to create the application registration in Entra ID, whenever this has been disabled for normal users, but Global Administrator permissions might be needed after this to set the desired permissions on the application registration. See determining which permissions you need for more information. Proceed in the section below which matches with your desired option for creating the application registration, automatically or manually. Automatically create an app registration for interactive login PnP PowerShell has a cmdlet that allows you to register a new Entra ID Application specifically for interactive login. Notice that you need to be able to create App registrations in your Entra ID. Register-PnPEntraIDAppForInteractiveLogin -ApplicationName \"PnP.PowerShell\" -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com When you run the cmdlet above you will be asked to authenticate with your username, password and an optional second factor. After that a new app will be registered in the Entra ID (make sure you have the rights to do this). By default a limited set of permissions scopes is added, but you can provide the one of the permission parameters (GraphApplicationPermissions, GraphDelegatePermissions, SharePointApplicationPermissions, SharePointDelegatePermissions) to provide your own permission scopes. After the app has been registered you will be asked to provide consent for the application. Alternatively you can ask someone with the appropriate access rights to navigate to the app registration in the Entra ID portal to add them for you. See determining which permissions you need for more information. Manually create an app registration for interactive login Another option is to manually create the application registration in Entra ID. While the automatic method above is by far the easiest and quickest, for those that like to fully understand each step of the process, can follow this steps in this paragraph in order to create it manually. Navigate to the Entra ID portal and authenticate with an account that has permissions to create application registrations Using the menu on the left, go to Identity > Applications > App registrations At the top, click on New registration In the Name field, enter any name you would like which indicates to you what the purpose of this script is. Leave the rest of the fields as they are and click on Register at the bottom of the page. Take note of the Application (client) ID value, as you will use this to connect to PnP PowerShell using the application registration you have just created In the menu, look for Manage and click on Authentication Under Platform configurations on the page, click on Add a platform In the panel that shows up on the right, click on Mobile and desktop applications Leave the three boxes shown in the panel on the right unchecked and in the Custom redirect URIs field, enter: http://localhost Note that this should really be http and not https Click on Configure at the bottom Under Manage go to API permissions In the Configured permissions section, click on the three dots in the line that reads Microsoft Graph (1) and click on Remove all permissions and click on Yes, remove in the confirmation dialog that will show up. In the Configured permissions section, click on Add a permission In the panel on the right, stay in the Microsoft APIs category and scroll down to SharePoint and click on it Click on Delegated permissions Expand AllSites and check the box for AllSites.Read or any other permission you wish to use with your application registration and click on Add permissions at the bottom Under Configured permissions click on Grant admin consent for -organization name- If this button is greyed out, it means you do not have the proper permissions to provide the consent. Log in using an account or ask someone having the Global Administrator role to perform this step for you if this is the case. In the panel on the right, select No, remove other granted permissions and click on Grant admin consent at the bottom. In the confirmation dialog that appears, click Yes. The Configured permissions section should now look similar to the screenshot below. You can now use this application to [connect to PnP PowerShell](connecting.md or add additional permissions to this application registration as necessary. Setting up access to your own Entra ID App for App Only Access If you're looking to register an application in Entra ID to use PnP PowerShell with a script that will run without requiring user interaction, App Only described in this section is what you want to go with. PnP PowerShell has a cmdlet that allows you to register a new Entra ID App, and optionally generate the certificates for you to use to login with that app. In the examples below, as are registering the app with the name PnP.PowerShell. You can choose a different name if you'd like. $result = Register-PnPEntraIDApp -ApplicationName \"PnP.PowerShell\" -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -OutPath c:\\mycertificates -DeviceLogin $result When you run the cmdlet above you will be asked to navigate to the shown url and enter the code shown. After that a new app will be registered in the Entra ID (make sure you have the rights to do this), and a certificate will be generated and uploaded to that app. After this a URL will be shown which you have to navigate to to provide consent for this application. By default a limited set of permissions scopes is added, but you can provide the one of the permission parameters (GraphApplicationPermissions, GraphDelegatePermissions, SharePointApplicationPermissions, SharePointDelegatePermissions) to provide your own permission scopes. It also returns the private key certificate encoded in base64 encoding. As it spans multiple lines, it is recommended to assign the outcome of Register-PnPEntraIDApp to a variable so you have access to this value more easily. The Base64 encoded private key certificate can be used in your Connect-PnPOnline voiding the need to have access to the physical file: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId [clientid] -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -CertificateBase64Encoded [pfx base64 encoded] The cmdlet will also save both the CER and PFX files to the location specified with the -Outpath parameter. The names of the files will be matching the -ApplicationName parameter, e.g. in the example above the files will be called PnP.PowerShell.cer and PnP.PowerShell.pfx. The output of the cmdlet will show the clientid. After all is set up and consent has been provided you can login using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId [clientid] -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -CertificatePath [certificate.pfx] Special instructions for GCC or National Cloud environments In order to set up your application registration on a GCC or a national cloud environment, you will have to take a few extra steps. In the two methods described above for interactive login and App Only access, you will have to add -AzureEnvironment [USGovernment|USGovernmentHigh|USGovernmentDoD|Germany|China] to the cmdlet picking the one that applies to your environment to register your application in Entra ID. For an application registration meant for interactive login, use: Register-PnPEntraIDAppForInteractiveLogin -ApplicationName \"PnP.PowerShell\" -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -AzureEnvironment [USGovernment|USGovernmentHigh|USGovernmentDoD|Germany|China] And for an App Only application registration, use: $result = Register-PnPEntraIDApp -ApplicationName \"PnP.PowerShell\" -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -OutPath c:\\mycertificates -DeviceLogin -AzureEnvironment [USGovernment|USGovernmentHigh|USGovernmentDoD|Germany|China] $result The above statement grants a few permission scopes. You might want to add more if you want to. Alternatively, after registering the application, navigate to Entra ID, locate the app registration, and grant more permissions and consent to them. Optionally modify the manifest for the app There is a limitation in the Entra ID for national cloud environments where you cannot select permission scopes for SharePoint Online. In order to add specific SharePoint rights you will have to manually add them to the manifest that you can edit in Entra ID: Locate the requiredResourceAccess section and add to or modify the existing entries. See the example below (notice, this is an example, do not copy and paste this as is as it will limit the permissions to only AllSites.FullControl): \"requiredResourceAccess\": [ { \"resourceAppId\": \"00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000\", \"resourceAccess\": [ { \"id\": \"56680e0d-d2a3-4ae1-80d8-3c4f2100e3d0\", \"type\": \"Scope\" } ] } You can add more permissions by using the following values: The resourceAppId for SharePoint = \"00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000\" Permission Permission type Id Type Sites.FullControl.All Application 678536fe-1083-478a-9c59-b99265e6b0d3 Role AllSites.FullControl Delegate 56680e0d-d2a3-4ae1-80d8-3c4f2100e3d0 Scope"

By using PnP PowerShell You can disable telemetry to be sent by using Disable-PnPPowerShellTelemetry. You can enable telemetry to be sent by using Enable-PnPPowerShellTelemetry. By setting an environment variable To disable telemetry, set the PNPPOWERSHELL_DISABLETELEMETRY environment variable to true, i.e. by using $env:PNPPOWERSHELL_DISABLETELEMETRY=$true.

Uninstall-Module -Name \"SharePointPnPPowerShellOnline\" -AllVersions -Force Now install the new module: Install-Module -Name \"PnP.PowerShell\" Setup authentication. The way PnP PowerShell authenticates you to your tenant has changed. We now use OAuth behind the scenes to authenticate you. We support username/password auth, device code auth and app-only authentication. If you were using Connect-PnPOnline with the -Credentials you will have to register first an Azure AD application on your tenant. This is very straightforward and simple: Register-PnPManagementShellAccess This cmdlet will ask you to authenticate, and then provide consent to the PnP Management Shell application. A registration will be added to the Azure AD of your tenant. This is a one-time action per tenant. After you provided consent you will be able to authenticate using: Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://[tenant].sharepoint.com -Credentials (Get-Credential) Read more information about authentication. Changes Check your scripts. As this is a major release, we have deprecated cmdlets, renamed cmdlets, and we marked some parameters as obsolete. Important We marked the -Web parameter as obsolete on many cmdlets. The -Web parameter allows you to execute cmdlets to a subweb underneath the current web. Due to API changes under the hood of PnP Powershell we marked this parameter as obsolete. The parameter will be removed in a future release.

See https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/connecting.html for more information on the options to connect. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" Connect to SharePoint prompting for the username and password. When a generic credential is added to the Windows Credential Manager with https://contoso.sharepoint.com, PowerShell will not prompt for username and password and use those stored credentials instead. You will have to register your own App first, by means of Register-PnPEntraIDApp to use this method. You will also have to provide the -ClientId parameter starting September 9, 2024. Alternatively, create an environment variable, call it ENTRAID_APP_ID or ENTRAID_CLIENT_ID and set the value to the app id you created EXAMPLE 2 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -Credentials (Get-Credential) Connect to SharePoint prompting for the username and password to use to authenticate. EXAMPLE 3 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.de\" -ClientId 344b8aab-389c-4e4a-8fa1-4c1ae2c0a60d -ClientSecret $clientSecret This will authenticate you to the site using Legacy ACS authentication EXAMPLE 4 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -DeviceLogin -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 This will authenticate you using the specified Entra ID App registration. Alternatively, create an environment variable, call it ENTRAID_APP_ID or ENTRAID_CLIENT_ID and set the value to the app id you created. A browser window will automatically open and the code you need to enter will be automatically copied to your clipboard. EXAMPLE 5 $password = (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText 'myprivatekeypassword' -Force) Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -CertificatePath 'c:\\mycertificate.pfx' -CertificatePassword $password -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' Connects using an Azure Active Directory registered application using a locally available certificate containing a private key. See https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread for a sample on how to get started. EXAMPLE 6 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' -Thumbprint 34CFAA860E5FB8C44335A38A097C1E41EEA206AA Connects to SharePoint using app-only tokens via an app's declared permission scopes. See https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/tree/master/Samples/SharePoint.ConnectUsingAppPermissions for a sample on how to get started. Ensure you have imported the private key certificate, typically the .pfx file, into the Windows Certificate Store for the certificate with the provided thumbprint. EXAMPLE 7 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -CertificateBase64Encoded $base64encodedstring -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' Connects using an Azure Active Directory registered application using a certificate with a private key that has been base64 encoded. See https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread for a sample on how to get started. EXAMPLE 8 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -Interactive -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 Connects to the Azure AD, acquires an access token and allows PnP PowerShell to access both SharePoint and the Microsoft Graph. Notice that you will have to register your own App first, by means of Register-PnPEntraIDApp to use this method. You will also have to provide the -ClientId parameter starting September 9, 2024. Alternatively, create an environment variable, call it ENTRAID_APP_ID or ENTRAID_CLIENT_ID and set the value to the app id you created. If you use -Interactive and this environment variable is present you will not have to use -ClientId. EXAMPLE 9 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://portal.contoso.com\" -TransformationOnPrem -CurrentCredential Connects to on-premises SharePoint 2013, 2016 or 2019 site with the current user's on-premises Windows credential (e.g. domain\\user). This option is only supported for being able to transform on-premises classic wiki, webpart, blog and publishing pages into modern pages in a SharePoint Online site. Although other PnP cmdlets might work as well, they're officially not supported for being used in an on-premises context. See http://aka.ms/sharepoint/modernization/pages for more details on page transformation. EXAMPLE 10 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ManagedIdentity Get-PnPTeamsTeam Connects using a system assigned managed identity to Microsoft Graph. Using this way of connecting only works with environments that support managed identities: Azure Functions, Azure Automation Runbooks and the Azure Cloud Shell. Read up on this article how it can be used. EXAMPLE 11 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ManagedIdentity -UserAssignedManagedIdentityObjectId 363c1b31-6872-47fd-a616-574d3aec2a51 Get-PnPList Connects using an user assigned managed identity with object/principal ID 363c1b31-6872-47fd-a616-574d3aec2a51 to SharePoint Online. Using this way of connecting only works with environments that support managed identities: Azure Functions, Azure Automation Runbooks and the Azure Cloud Shell. Read up on this article how it can be used. EXAMPLE 12 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -AccessToken $token This method assumes you have acquired a valid OAuth2 access token from Azure AD with the correct audience and permissions set. Using this method PnP PowerShell will not acquire tokens dynamically and if the token expires (typically after 1 hour) cmdlets will fail to work using this method. EXAMPLE 13 Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -EnvironmentVariable -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' This example uses the AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH and AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD environment variable values to authenticate. The AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variable must be present and Tenant parameter value must be provided. If these environment variables are not present, it will try to find ENTRAID_APP_CERTIFICATE_PATH or ENTRAID_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH and for certificate password use ENTRAID_APP_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD or ENTRAID_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD as fallback. EXAMPLE 14 Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -EnvironmentVariable This example uses the AZURE_USERNAME and AZURE_PASSWORD environment variables as credentials to authenticate. If these environment variables are not available, it will use ENTRAID_USERNAME and ENTRAID_PASSWORD environment variables as fallback. If AZURE_CLIENT_ID is not present, alternatively it will try to use ENTRAID_APP_ID or ENTRAID_CLIENT_ID environment variables as fallback. This method assumes you have the necessary environment variables available. For more information about the required environment variables, please refer to this article, Azure.Identity Environment Variables here. So, when using -EnvironmentVariable method for authenticating, we will require AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH, AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD and AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variables for using the service principal with certificate method for authentication. If AZURE_USERNAME, AZURE_PASSWORD and AZURE_CLIENT_ID, we will use these environment variables and authenticate using credentials flow. If ENTRAID_USERNAME, ENTRAID_PASSWORD and ENTRAID_APP_ID , we will use these environment variables and authenticate using credentials flow. We support only Service principal with certificate and Username with password mode for authentication. Configuration will be attempted in that order. For example, if values for a certificate and username+password are both present, the client certificate method will be used. EXAMPLE 15 Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -AzureEnvironment Custom -MicrosoftGraphEndPoint \"custom.graph.microsoft.com\" -AzureADLoginEndPoint \"https://custom.login.microsoftonline.com\" Use this method to connect to a custom Azure Environment. You can also specify the MicrosoftGraphEndPoint and AzureADLoginEndPoint parameters if applicable. If specified, then these values will be used to make requests to Graph and to retrieve access token. EXAMPLE 16 Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -AzureADWorkloadIdentity This example uses Azure AD Workload Identity to retrieve access tokens. For more information about this, please refer to this article, Azure AD Workload Identity. We are following the guidance mentioned in this sample to retrieve the access tokens. EXAMPLE 17 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -OSLogin Connects to the Azure AD with WAM (aka native Windows authentication prompt), acquires an access token and allows PnP PowerShell to access both SharePoint and the Microsoft Graph. Notice that you will have to register your own App first, by means of Register-PnPEntraIDAdd to use this method. You will also have to provide the -ClientId parameter starting September 9, 2024. Alternatively, create an environment variable, call it ENTRAID_APP_ID or ENTRAID_CLIENT_ID and set the value to the app id you created. WAM is a more secure & faster way of authenticating in Windows OS. It supports Windows Hello, FIDO keys , conditional access policies and more. EXAMPLE 18 $keyStorageflags = [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509KeyStorageFlags]::MachineKeySet -bor [System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certificates.X509KeyStorageFlags]::PersistKeySet Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -CertificateBase64Encoded $base64encodedstring -X509KeyStorageFlags $keyStorageflags -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' Connects using an Azure Active Directory registered application using a certificate with a private key that has been base64 encoded. See Security App-only EntraId guidance for a sample on how to get started. See X509 key storage flags for information on how to configure key storage when creating the certificate. EXAMPLE 19 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -Credentials \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" Connect to SharePoint using Credentials (username and password) from Credential Manager (Windows) or Keychain (Mac) with the specified name to use to authenticate.

The Copy-PnPItemProxy cmdlet copies an item from one location to another location in the same namespace. For instance, it can copy a file to a folder, but it can't copy a file to a certificate drive. This cmdlet doesn't cut or delete the items being copied. The particular items that the cmdlet can copy depend on the PowerShell provider that exposes the item. For instance, it can copy files and directories in a file system drive and registry keys and entries in the registry drive. This cmdlet can copy and rename items in the same command. To rename an item, enter the new name in the value of the Destination parameter. To rename an item and not copy it, use the Rename-Item cmdlet. For more information and details, please refer to the official PowerShell documentation here. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Copy-PnPItemProxy \"C:\\Users\\Admin\\seattle.master\" -Destination \"C:\\Presentation\" This example copies the seattle.master file to the C:\\Presentation directory.

Creates a copy of a team. This operation also creates a copy of the corresponding group. You can specify which parts of the team to clone: apps - Copies Microsoft Teams apps that are installed in the team. channels – Copies the channel structure (but not the messages in the channel). members – Copies the members and owners of the group. settings – Copies all settings within the team, along with key group settings. tabs – Copies the tabs within channels. When tabs are cloned, they are put into an un configured state -- they are displayed on the tab bar in Microsoft Teams, and the first time you open them, you'll go through the configuration screen. If the person opening the tab does not have permission to configure apps, they will see a message explaining that the tab hasn't been configured.

It can be used to list all files and folders in a folder and optionally all its subfolders. When working with a document library containing over 5,000 items in it, you will need to use the -List parameter to specify the document library in order to be able to retrieve the Files and Folders in it. It will always recursively retrieve all files and folders in the document library. It is still possible to use -ItemType to restrict the results to only files or folders. You can also use -Includes to fetch additional properties of the files and folders. Start the property name with \"File.\" or \"Folder.\" followed by the property name of the file or folder. For example, to include the file version history report, pass in -Includes \"File.VersionExpirationReport\". Use Get-PnPFileInFolder to retrieve only files and Get-PnPFolderInFolder to retrieve only folders allowing additional properties of the returned items to be requested. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Get-PnPFolderItem Returns all the files and folders in the root of the current web EXAMPLE 2 Get-PnPFolderItem -Recurse Returns all the files and folders in the entire site. This will take a while to complete and will cause a lot of calls to be made towards SharePoint Online. Use it wisely. EXAMPLE 3 Get-PnPFolderItem -Identity \"Shared Documents\" Returns the files and folders located in the 'Shared Documents' folder located in the root of the current web EXAMPLE 4 Get-PnPFolderItem -FolderSiteRelativeUrl \"SitePages\" -ItemName \"Default.aspx\" Returns the file 'Default.aspx' which is located in the folder SitePages which is located in the root of the current web EXAMPLE 5 Get-PnPFolderItem -FolderSiteRelativeUrl \"SitePages\" -ItemType Folder Returns all subfolders of the folder SitePages which is located in the root of the current web EXAMPLE 6 Get-PnPFolder -Url \"Shared Documents\" | Get-PnPFolderItem -ItemType File Returns all files in the \"Shared Documents\" folder which is located in the root of the current web EXAMPLE 7 Get-PnPFolderItem -FolderSiteRelativeUrl \"SitePages\" -Recursive Returns all files and folders, including contents of any subfolders, in the folder SitePages which is located in the root of the current web PARAMETERS -Connection Optional connection to be used by the cmdlet.

Note that for a newly created modern site, the Columns and Sections of the Home.aspx page will not be filled according to the actual site page contents. This is because the underlying CanvasContent1 will not be populated until the homepage has been edited and published. The reason for this behavior is to allow for the default homepage to be able to be updated by Microsoft as long as it hasn't been modified. For any other site page or after editing and publishing the homepage, this command will return the correct columns and sections as they are positioned on the site page. Also note that if you want to retrieve all site pages in a site by omitting the -Identity parameter, the command will return all pages in the Site Pages library, but with less details and will require SharePoint Online Administrator permissions to do so. This is how it has been designed on the server side. If you want the full details on all pages, you can do it as follows Get-PnPPage | % { Get-PnPPage -Identity $_.Name }. Be aware that this causes a lot of server calls and is much slower than the first command.

It can return the messages from an in memory log stream or from a file. Note that you cannot read from a log file if it is currently in use to write to. In this case, you would first have to stop logging to it using Stop-PnPTraceLog and then read the log file. The in memory log stream is always available. You can use Start-PnPTraceLog to start logging to a file and/or to an in memory stream. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Get-PnPTraceLog This returns all items in the in memory stored log stream EXAMPLE 2 Get-PnPTraceLog -Path \"C:\\temp\\log.txt\" This returns all items from the log file stored at the provided location. Note that you cannot read from a log file if it is currently in use to write to. In this case, you would first have to stop logging to it using Stop-PnPTraceLog and then read the log file. EXAMPLE 3 Get-PnPTraceLog | Where-Object { $_.Level -eq \"Error\" } This returns only logged items from the in memory stored log stream that have a level of \"Error\" EXAMPLE 4 Get-PnPTraceLog | Where-Object { $_.CorrelationId -eq \"5a6206a0-6c83-4446-9d1b-38c14f93cb60\" } This returns only logged items from the in memory stored log stream that happened during the execution of a PnP PowerShell cmdlet with the provided correlation id. This is useful to find out what happened during the execution of a specific cmdlet. Mind that the correlation id is an unique identifier for the cmdlet execution assigned by PnP PowerShell and is not the same as the correlation id of a SharePoint operation. EXAMPLE 5 Get-PnPTraceLog | Sort-Object -Property EllapsedMilliseconds -Descending -Top 10 | Select EllapsedMilliseconds, Source, Message Returns the 10 longest running operations from the in memory stored log stream. An operation is an action within the execution of a cmdlet. The output is sorted by the time it took to complete the operation with the longest execution at the top. The output shows the ellapsed time in milliseconds taken by a single operation, the cmdlet that was executed and the message that was logged. EXAMPLE 6 Get-PnPTraceLog | Group-Object -Property CorrelationId | ForEach-Object { [pscustomobject]@{ Started = ($_.Group | Select -First 1).TimeStamp; Ended = ($_.Group | Select -Last 1).TimeStamp; Cmdlet = $_.Group[0].Source; TimeTaken = ($_.Group | Measure-Object -Property EllapsedMilliseconds -Sum).Sum; Logs = $_.Group }} | Sort-Object -Property TimeTaken -Descending -Top 5 | Select Started, Cmdlet, TimeTaken Returns the top 5 longest running cmdlets from the in memory stored log stream. The output is sorted by the TimeTaken property in descending order which shows the total execution time of a single cmdlet. The output contains the time the cmdlet started executing, the cmdlet that was executed and the total time it took to execute the cmdlet. From there it is easy to examine all the individual logs collected during the execution of that single cmdlet. PARAMETERS -Path The path to the log file. If not provided, the cmdlet will return the in memory log stream. Note that you cannot read from a log file if it is currently in use to write to.

    "keywords": "Import-PnPTermSet SYNOPSIS Imports a taxonomy term set from a file in the standard format. SYNTAX Import-PnPTermSet -GroupName <String> -Path <String> [-TermSetId <Guid>] [-SynchronizeDeletions] [-IsOpen <Boolean>] [-Contact <String>] [-Owner <String>] [-TermStoreName <String>] [-Connection <PnPConnection>] DESCRIPTION The format of the file is the same as that used by the import function in the web interface. A sample file can be obtained from the web interface. This is a CSV file, with the following headings: Term Set Name,Term Set Description,LCID,Available for Tagging,Term Description,Level 1 Term,Level 2 Term,Level 3 Term,Level 4 Term,Level 5 Term,Level 6 Term,Level 7 Term The first data row must contain the Term Set Name, Term Set Description, and LCID, and should also contain the first term. It is recommended that a fixed GUID be used as the termSetId, to allow the term set to be easily updated (so do not pass Guid.Empty). In contrast to the web interface import, this is not a one-off import but runs synchronization logic allowing updating of an existing Term Set. When synchronizing, any existing terms are matched (with Term Description and Available for Tagging updated as necessary), any new terms are added in the correct place in the hierarchy, and (if synchronizeDeletions is set) any terms not in the imported file are removed. The import file also supports an expanded syntax for the Term Set Name and term names (Level 1 Term, Level 2 Term, etc). These columns support values with the format 'Name | GUID', with the name and GUID separated by a pipe character (note that the pipe character is invalid to use within a taxonomy item name). This expanded syntax is not required, but can be used to ensure all terms have fixed IDs. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Import-PnPTermSet -GroupName 'Standard Terms' -Path 'C:\\\\Temp\\\\ImportTermSet.csv' -SynchronizeDeletions Creates (or updates) the term set specified in the import file, in the group specified, removing any existing terms not in the file.

    "keywords": "Invoke-PnPSiteSwap SYNOPSIS Invokes a job to swap the location of a site with another site while archiving the original site. SYNTAX Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl <string> -TargetUrl <string> -ArchiveUrl <string> [-DisableRedirection] [-NoWait] [-Verbose] [-Connection <PnPConnection>] DESCRIPTION Swaps the location of a source site with a target site while archiving the original target site. Please note, the target site must be either: The root site, for example https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com; or The search center site, for example https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/search. When the swap is initiated, the target site is moved to the archive location and the source site is moved to the target location. By default, a site redirect is created at the source location that will redirect traffic to the target location. If the target is the root site at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com, then the following preparation activities should be performed prior to performing the swap: Any Featured links defined in SharePoint Start Page at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx will not be displayed after performing the swap. If required, the Featured links should be documented so they can be manually recreated after the swap. Functionality such as external sharing and application interfaces are dependent on the policies and permissions defined at the root site. Review the source site to ensure that it has the required policies and permissions as per the existing root site. This includes external sharing settings as well as site permissions. Larger tenants that have more than ~10,000 licenses may also need to run the Page Diagnostic Tool against the source site. Any analysis results that have the category Attention required (Red) or Improvement opportunities (Orange) will need to be remediated before performing the swap. The source and target sites can't be connected to an Office 365 group. They also can't be hub sites or associated with a hub. If a site is a hub site, unregister it as a hub site, swap the root site, and then register the site as a hub site. If a site is associated with a hub, disassociate the site, swap the root site, and then re-associate the site. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite -TargetUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com -ArchiveUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive Archives the existing site at https://contoso.sharepoint.com to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive and moves https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite to https://contoso.sharepoint.com. A site redirect will be created at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite that will redirect any requests to https://contoso.sharepoint.com. EXAMPLE 2 Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SearchSite -TargetUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search -ArchiveUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive Archives the existing Search Center site at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive and moves the https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SearchSite to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search. A site redirect be created at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SearchSite that will redirect any requests to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search. EXAMPLE 3 Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite -TargetUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com -ArchiveUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive -DisableRedirection Archives the existing site at https://contoso.sharepoint.com to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive and moves https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite to https://contoso.sharepoint.com. A site redirect will not be created at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite. PARAMETERS -SourceUrl URL of the source site. The site at this location must exist before performing the swap. If the target is the root site at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com then the source site must be either a Modern Team Site (STS#3) or a Communication Site (SITEPAGEPUBLISHING#0).

SYNTAX Reset file Reset-PnPDocumentId -File <FilePipeBind> [-Verbose] [-Connection <PnPConnection>] Reset library Reset-PnPDocumentId -Library <ListPipeBind> -ContentType <ContentTypePipeBind> [-Verbose] [-Connection <PnPConnection>] DESCRIPTION This cmdlet allows requesting SharePoint Online to recalculate and reassign the unique document ID of a specific file or of all files using a specific content type in a document library. This can be useful if the document ID of a file has been lost, has gotten corrupted or duplicated. The unique document ID will be calculated based on an internal predictable algorithm and will contain parts of the site collection, web, list and listitem. When applying this to a specific file, it should only take seconds for it to recalculate and reassign the document ID. When applying it to the entire library, it may take up to 24 hours to process the request. If the document ID remains the same after running this cmdlet, it means the assigned document ID is correct. There's no use of running it multiple times on the same file. You need to be connected to the same site collection in which the file on which you wish to perform the operation resides.

Sending e-mail through Microsoft Graph requires the Mail.Send permission. In October 2025, Microsoft will remove the API which is being used to send e-mail through SharePoint. It is therefore highly recommended to use the Microsoft Graph option listed above instead. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Send-PnPMail -From \"user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\" -To \"recipient@contoso.com\" -Subject \"Test message\" -Body \"This is a test message\" Sends an e-mail using Microsoft Graph to one recipient. E-mail is sent from the user specified in the From parameter and can be sent to both internal and external addresses. A copy of the sent e-mail will be stored in the mailbox of the user specified in the From parameter. EXAMPLE 2 Send-PnPMail -From \"sharedmailbox@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\" -To \"recipient1@contoso.com\",\"recipient2@contoso.com\",\"recipient3@contoso.com\" -Cc \"recipient4@contoso.com\" -Bcc \"recipient5@contoso.com\" -Subject \"Test message\" -Body \"This is a test message\" -Importance Low Sends an e-mail using Microsoft Graph from a shared mailbox to multiple recipients. E-mail is sent from the shared mailbox specified in the From parameter and can be sent to both internal and external addresses. A copy of the sent e-mail will be stored in the shared mailbox. EXAMPLE 3 Send-PnPMail -To \"address@tenant.microsoftonline.com\" -Subject \"Test message\" -Body \"This is a test message\" Sends an e-mail using the SharePoint Online SendEmail method using the current context. E-mail is sent from the SharePoint Online no-reply e-mail address and can only be sent to accounts in the same tenant. The from address will show the title of the site you are connected with along with the e-mail address no-reply@sharepointonline.com. EXAMPLE 4 Send-PnPMail -From \"user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\" -To \"recipient@contoso.com\" -Subject \"Test message\" -Body \"This is a test message\" -Attachments \"C:\\PnPCommunity\\Test\\test.docx\" Sends an e-mail using Microsoft Graph to one recipient. E-mail is sent from the user specified in the From parameter and can be sent to both internal and external addresses. A copy of the sent e-mail will be stored in the mailbox of the user specified in the From parameter. It will also upload the file from the local file system as attachment. EXAMPLE 5 Send-PnPMail -From \"user@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\" -To \"recipient@contoso.com\" -Subject \"Test message\" -Body \"This is a test message\" -Files \"/sites/test/Shared Documents/Test.docx\" Sends an e-mail using Microsoft Graph to one recipient. E-mail is sent from the user specified in the From parameter and can be sent to both internal and external addresses. A copy of the sent e-mail will be stored in the mailbox of the user specified in the From parameter. It will also upload the file from the SharePoint site collection and send it as attachment.

SYNTAX Set-PnPSiteDocumentIdPrefix -DocumentIdPrefix <string> [-ScheduleAssignment <boolean>] [-OverwriteExistingIds <boolean>] [-Verbose] [-Connection <PnPConnection>] DESCRIPTION This cmdlet allows changing of the document Id prefix that has been assigned to a site. It essentially does what you can also do using the page /_layouts/15/DocIdSettings.aspx in the SharePoint Online web interface. It also offers an option to reset the currently assigned document Ids of all files within a site. You need to be connected to the sitecollection of which you want to change the document Id prefix. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Set-PnPSiteDocumentIdPrefix \"TEST\" This will change the document Id prefix to TEST for all new documents created in the current site collection. EXAMPLE 2 Set-PnPSiteDocumentIdPrefix \"TEST\" -ScheduleAssignment $true -OverwriteExistingIds $true This will change the document Id prefix to TEST for all existing and new documents in the current site collection. Note that this will take a while (possibly up to 48 hours) to complete as SharePoint Online will need to recalculate and reassign the unique document Id of all files in the site collection. PARAMETERS -DocumentIdPrefix The new prefix you would like to start using for the Document ID feature in the current site collection.

If the site has a Microsoft 365 Group behind it, the label will be placed on the Microsoft 365 Group and will require either Group.ReadWrite.All or Directory.ReadWrite.All delegate permissions on Microsoft Graph. This currently cannot be done using App Only permissions due to a limitation in Microsoft Graph. If it does not have a Microsoft 365 Group behind it, it will set the label on the SharePoint Online site and will not require Microsoft Graph permissions and will work with both delegate as well as app only logins. If you're looking to set a sensitivity label on a Microsoft 365 Group backed site in an App Only context, you can use Set-PnPTenantSite -SensitivityLabel instead to do so. It may take up to a few minutes for a change to the sensitivity label to become visible in SharePoint Online and Entra ID / Azure Active Directory. Use Get-PnPAvailableSensitivityLabel to get an overview of the available Microsoft Purview sensitivity labels on the tenant. For the classic classification labels, use Set-PnPSiteClassification instead. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Set-PnPSiteSensitivityLabel -Identity \"Top Secret\" Sets the Microsoft Purview sensitivity label with the name \"Top Secret\" on the current site EXAMPLE 2 Set-PnPSiteSensitivityLabel -Identity a1888df2-84c2-4379-8d53-7091dd630ca7 Sets the Microsoft Purview sensitivity label with the Id a1888df2-84c2-4379-8d53-7091dd630ca7 on the current site PARAMETERS -Identity Id or name of the Microsoft Purview sensitivity label to apply Type: String Parameter Sets: (All) Required: True Position: Named Default value: True Accept pipeline input: True Accept wildcard characters: False -Connection Optional connection to be used by the cmdlet.

This allows these users to temporarily view and collaborate on whiteboards when they’re shared in a Teams meeting, similar to PowerPoint Live sharing. If you have the external sharing for OneDrive for Business allowed, no further action is required. If you have external sharing for OneDrive for Business disabled, you can leave it disabled but you must enable this new setting. The setting will not take effect until the SharingCapability 'ExternalUserAndGuestSharing' is also enabled at Tenant level. For more information, see Enable Microsoft Whiteboard for your organization. The valid values are: ExternalUserAndGuestSharing (default) : External user sharing (share by email) and guest link sharing are both enabled. Disabled : External user sharing (share by email) and guest link sharing are both disabled. ExternalUserSharingOnly : External user sharing (share by email) is enabled, but guest link sharing is disabled. ExistingExternalUserSharingOnly : Only guests already in your organization's directory.

Type: Boolean Parameter Sets: (All) Required: False Position: Named Default value: None Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False -AllowAnonymousMeetingParticipantsToAccessWhiteboards When you share a whiteboard in a Teams meeting, Whiteboard creates a sharing link. This link is accessible by anyone within the organization. The whiteboard is also shared with any in-tenant users in the meeting. Whiteboards are shared using company-shareable links, regardless of the default setting. Support for the default sharing link type is planned. There's more capability for temporary collaboration by external and shared device accounts during a Teams meeting. Users can temporarily view and collaborate on whiteboards that are shared in a meeting, in a similar way to PowerPoint Live sharing. In this case, Whiteboard provides temporary viewing and collaboration on the whiteboard during the Teams meeting only. A share link isn't created and Whiteboard doesn't grant access to the file. If you have external sharing enabled for OneDrive for Business, no further action is required. If you restrict external sharing for OneDrive for Business, you can keep it restricted, and just enable this new setting in order for external and shared device accounts to work.

Users have browser-only access to play the meeting recordings with no ability to download or sync files or access them through apps. This policy applies to new meeting recordings across the entire organization. You can exempt people who are members of specified security groups from the policy. This allows you to specify governance or compliance specialists who should have download access to meeting recordings. After the policy is turned on, any new Teams meeting recording files created by the Teams service and saved in SharePoint and OneDrive are blocked from download. Because this policy affects meeting recordings stored in OneDrive and SharePoint, you must be a SharePoint administrator to configure it.

Many cmdlets output detailed trace information when executed. Turn on the trace log with this cmdlet, optionally specify the level. By default the level is set to 'Information', but you will receive more detail by setting the level to 'Debug'. You can look at the logged data using Get-PnPTraceLog. The logged data contains the following information in the following order: Timestamp Source Thread ID Log level Message Elapsed time in milliseconds since the last log entry for the same cmdlet execution Correlation ID which is an unique identifier per executed cmdlet so you can filter the log for everything logged during a specific cmdlet execution Beware that the logged data can be quite verbose, especially when the level is set to 'Debug'. When logging in memory, it can take up a lot of memory. When logging to a file, it can take up a lot of disk space. So be careful when using this in production environments and only use it when you need to troubleshoot something or are aware of the consequences. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Start-PnPTraceLog -Path ./TraceOutput.txt This turns on trace logging to the file 'TraceOutput.txt' and will capture events of at least 'Information' level. EXAMPLE 2 Start-PnPTraceLog -Path ./TraceOutput.txt -Level Debug This turns on trace logging to the file 'TraceOutput.txt' and will capture all events. EXAMPLE 3 Start-PnPTraceLog -WriteToConsole -WriteToLogStream -Level Debug This turns on trace logging to the console and in memory stream in which you are running your PowerShell script and will capture all events.

    "keywords": "Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory SYNOPSIS Required Permissions SharePoint: Sites.FullControl.All, TermStore.ReadWrite.All, User.ReadWrite.All Microsoft Graph: User.Read ACS: No longer needed Synchronizes user profiles from Entra ID into the SharePoint Online User Profiles SYNTAX Upload file Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping <Hashtable> [-IdType <Enum>] [-Users <Array>] [-Folder <String>] [-Wait] [-Verbose] [-Connection <PnPConnection>] [-WhatIf] DESCRIPTION This cmdlet allows synchronizing user profiles from Entra ID to their SharePoint Online User Profile equivalents. Note that certain properties are already synced by default. A list of these can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/user-profile-sync#properties-that-are-synced-into-sharepoint-user-profiles For other properties not listed on this page, you can use this cmdlet to synchronize them. You can provide the property name(s) in Entra ID and specify its equivalent property in SharePoint Online for the values to be mapped to. Note that SharePoint Online User Profile properties you wish to sync to must have the checkbox unchecked for \"Allow users to edit values for this property\" in the user profile property in the SharePoint User Profile service application. It also must have \"User can override\" checked under Policy Settings of the user profile property in the SharePoint User Profile service application. When running this cmdlet, it will upload a file named userprofilesyncdata-<timestamp>-<guid>.json to the document library of the SharePoint Online site you are connected to. From there an asynchronous process will be started that processes the JSON file and updates the user profiles on the SharePoint Online side. The time before this process starts varies. Once that process is done and only if something failed, you will find a new folder created in the same document library of which the folder name starts with the same name as the filename. It will contain a .log file in which you can find the results of it trying to update the user profiles in SharePoint Online which were specified in the JSON file. If all the user profile properties have been updated successfully, it will not create such a folder and log file. You can also query the import job status using Get-PnPUPABulkImportStatus -JobId <jobid>. The jobid will be returned upon running this cmdlet and can be fed into this cmdlet to get the actual status. It will show State: Submitted after running this cmdlet and before processing it and State: Succeeded once its done and was successful or State: Error if it failed. It will also return full details on the file it will use to update the user profiles and the location of the log file once its done processing and only if it failed. For documentation on all the possible states it can be in, see https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/bulk-user-profile-update-api-for-sharepoint-online#parameters-2. When not providing -Users, it will fetch all the users and the properties defined in the mapping from Entra ID itself. You can also opt to query for a subset of Entra ID users to update using i.e. Get-PnPAzureAdUser and feed the outcome of that to the -Users parameter. In this case you must ensure that the user objects you supply contain the properties you wish to sync towards SharePoint Online. When not providing -Folder, it will assume a document library named \"Shared Documents\" is present within the site collection you're currently connected to. In case you are not using an English site collection, this name may be different and localized. In that case use the -Folder parameter passing in the localized name of the document library you wish to upload the mapping file to. Required Permissions It is no longer needed to use ACS permissions for this cmdlet to work. The following permissions, granted through an Entra ID application registration, should suffice. It can also be used using a Managed Identity within Azure using the same permissions. SharePoint: Sites.FullControl.All, TermStore.ReadWrite.All, User.ReadWrite.All Microsoft Graph: User.Read EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping @{\"HomePhone\"=\"phone\";\"CustomProperty\"=\"DisplayName\"} This will retrieve all users in Entra ID and take its phone property to update in the HomePhone field in the SharePoint Online user profiles for each of these users. Similarly it will set the SharePoint Online User Profile property named CustomProperty to the value of the DisplayName as set in Entra ID on the user object. It will upload the JSON file with the instructions for the update to the 'Shared Documents' library of the site currently connected to. EXAMPLE 2 $users = Get-PnPAzureADUser -Filter \"jobTitle eq 'IT Administrator'\" Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping @{\"CostCenter\"=\"extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter\"} -Users $users This will update the CostCenter SharePoint Online User Profile property with the value of the property extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter coming from Entra ID for the users getting returned by the Get-PnPAzureADUser query. It will upload the JSON file with the instructions for the update to the 'Shared Documents' library of the site currently connected to. EXAMPLE 3 $delta = Get-PnPAzureADUser -Delta -DeltaToken $delta.DeltaToken Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping @{\"CostCenter\"=\"extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter\"} -Users $delta.Users This will retrieve all the users from Entra ID and includes a DeltaToken in the response. Using the DeltaToken you can retrieve only those users which have had changes done to their attributes since the DeltaToken was given out. This makes it ideal to use with the profile sync as this way you only will sync those users that have had changes to their profiles. Only for those users this will update the CostCenter SharePoint Online User Profile property with the value of the property extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter coming from Entra ID. It will upload the JSON file with the instructions for the update to the 'Shared Documents' library of the site currently connected to. EXAMPLE 4 Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping @{\"CostCenter\"=\"extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter\"} -Folder \"User Profile Sync\" This will retrieve all users in Entra ID and take its extension property named CostCenter to update in the CostCenter field in the SharePoint Online user profiles for each of these users. It will upload the JSON file with the instructions for the update to a library named 'User Profile Sync' in the site currently connected to. EXAMPLE 5 Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping @{\"CostCenter\"=\"extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter\"} -Folder \"User Profile Sync\\Jobs\" -Wait -Verbose This will retrieve all users in Entra ID and take its extension property named CostCenter to update in the CostCenter field in the SharePoint Online user profiles for each of these users. It will upload the JSON file with the instructions for the update to the folder Jobs inside a library named 'User Profile Sync' in the site currently connected to. It will wait with continuing the execution of the remainder of your script until the synchronization process has either completed or failed. It will output verbose logging to provide input on its status while executing. Notice that it may very well take 10 minutes or more for the synchronization to complete.

EXAMPLE 2 Write-PnPTraceLog \"Hello World\" -Level Warning This logs the message \"Hello World\" as an warning message to the built in logging. EXAMPLE 3 Write-PnPTraceLog \"Hello World\" -Level Error -Source \"MyScript\" This logs the message \"Hello World\" as an error message to the built in logging with a source of \"MyScript\". The source is used to identify the cmdlet that was executed when the log was created. This is useful to identify which part of your script was executing when the log was created. EXAMPLE 4 Write-PnPTraceLog \"Hello World\" -Level Debug -Source \"MyScript\" -CorrelationId \"5a6206a0-6c83-4446-9d1b-38c14f93cb60\" -EllapsedMilliseconds 1000 This is the most complete example. It logs the message \"Hello World\" as a debug message to the built in logging with a source of \"MyScript\", a correlation id of \"5a6206a0-6c83-4446-9d1b-38c14f93cb60\" and an ellapsed time of 1000 milliseconds. The correlation id is used to identify the set of operations that were executed when the log was created. The ellapsed time is used to identify how long the operation took to complete. You can provide your own measurements to define this value. If you omit the ellapsed time, the cmdlet will try to define the execution time based on the last logged entry. PARAMETERS -CorrelationId An optional GUID as an unique identifier for the cmdlet execution. This is useful to identify which part of your script was executing when the log was created. If not provided, it will leave the value empty. Type: Guid Parameter Sets: (All) Required: False Position: Named Default value: None Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False -EllapsedMilliseconds You can optionaly provide the ellapsed time in milliseconds. This is the time that was taken to execute the operation. If you omit this parameter, the cmdlet will try to define the execution time based on the last logged entry. Type: Long Parameter Sets: (All) Required: False Position: Named Default value: None Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False -Level The level to log your message under. Options are: Verbose, Information, Warning, Error and Debug. It will log it both to the default PowerShell its logging equivallent such as Write-Warning, Write-Error, Write-Verbose, and to the PnPTraceLog logging. If not provided, it will default to Information. Type: Framework.Diagnostics.LogLevel Parameter Sets: (All) Required: False Position: Named Default value: Information Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False -Message The message to log. This is the message that will be logged to the log file or the in memory stream. Type: String Parameter Sets: (All) Required: True Position: Named Default value: None Accept pipeline input: True Accept wildcard characters: False -Source The source of the log. This is the source that will be logged to the log file or the in memory stream. This is useful to identify which part of your script was executing when the log was created. Type: String Parameter Sets: (All) Required: False Position: Named Default value: None Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False -Verbose When provided, additional debug statements will be shown while executing the cmdlet. Type: SwitchParameter Parameter Sets: (All) Required: False Position: Named Default value: None Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False RELATED LINKS Microsoft 365 Patterns and Practices"

    "keywords": "PnP PowerShell PnP PowerShell is a cross-platform PowerShell Module providing over 700 cmdlets that work with Microsoft 365 environments and products such as SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Planner, Microsoft Power Platform, Microsoft Entra, Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Search, and more. It runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Note As of September 9th, 2024, as part of a focus on improving the security posture, the multi-tenant PnP Management Shell Entra ID app (with Client/ApplicationID: 31359c7f-bd7e-475c-86db-fdb8c937548e) has been deleted. It impacts credentials(username + password), Interactive auth flow and Device login flow if it depended on the said multi-tenant app. It has always been a recommended practice to register your own Entra ID Application with minimal permissions required for your scripts to use with PnP PowerShell. This has become a mandatory step now. The linked post has more details and it will guide you through how to do so and get your scripts back up & running with minimal code changes. Getting up and running Starting to use PnP PowerShell consists out of 3 steps: Installing the PnP.PowerShell module Registering your own Entra ID Application Connecting and authenticating Once you're set up, check out the cmdlets section to discover what you can do and how to use the cmdlets. Have a look at the articles section covering various topics how to get the most out of using PnP PowerShell. I've found a bug, where do I need to log an issue or create a PR You can create an issue at https://github.com/pnp/powershell/issues, but please consider first if asking a question at https://github.com/pnp/powershell/discussions is more appropriate. We would like to focus the issues on actual bugs whereas PnP PowerShell related questions can be asked in the discussions section. As some of the code being PnP PowerShell is actually coming from other PnP repositories, we can move your issue over to that specific repository. You will be notified by email about that. Before you start to work on code change consider starting a discussion in the repository first. It could potentially save you a lot of time if someone is about to submit a change with exactly the same functionality. It will also allow you to discuss a possible change with the maintainers of the repository before you start to work on it. Contributing to PnP PowerShell Follow the getting started contributing guidelines to help out. Sharing is caring! Supportability and SLA This library is open-source and community provided library with active community providing support for it. This is not Microsoft provided module so there's no SLA or direct support for this open-source component from Microsoft. Please report any issues using the issues list. This project has adopted the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct. For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments."
