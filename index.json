    "title": "Authentication | PnP PowerShell",
    "keywords": "Authentication Setting up Access PnP PowerShell allows you to authenticate with credentials to your tenant. However, due to changes in the underlying SDKs we require you first to register an Entra ID Application which will allow you to authenticate. Important This functionality will stop working on the 9th of September of 2024. Register your own Entra ID application instead. See lower in this article for more information. The easiest way to do this by using a built-in cmdlet: Register-PnPManagementShellAccess You'll notice that the cmdlet is not called Register-PnPPowerShellAccess. This is because both PnP PowerShell and the CLI for Microsoft 365 make use of this Entra ID application. Important You need to run this cmdlet with an identity that has write access to the Entra ID. You are not creating a new application in the sense of something that runs in your Entra ID tenant. You're only adding a registration to your Entra ID, a so called 'consent' for people in your tenant to use that application. The access rights the application requires are delegate only, so you will always have to provide credentials or another way of identifying the user actually using that application. During execution of the cmdlet you will be talked through the consent flow. This means that a browser window will open, you will be asked to authenticate, and you will be asked to consent to a number of permissions. After this permissions has been granted a new entry will show up if you navigate to Enterprise Applications in your Entra ID. If you want to revoke the consent you can simply remove the entry from the Enterprise Applications. Setting up access to your own Entra ID App for Interactive Login PnP PowerShell has a cmdlet that allows you to register a new Entra ID App specifically for interactive login. Notice that you need to be able to create App registrations in your Entra ID. Register-PnPEntraIDAppForInteractiveLogin -ApplicationName \"PnP Rocks\" -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -Interactive When you run the cmdlet above you will be asked to authenticate with your username, password and an optional second factor. After that a new app will be registered in the Entra ID (make sure you have the rights to do this). By default a limited set of permissions scopes is added, but you can provide the one of the permission parameters (GraphApplicationPermissions, GraphDelegatePermissions, SharePointApplicationPermissions, SharePointDelegatePermissions) to provide your own permission scopes. After the app has been registered you will be asked to provide consent for the application. Alternatively you can ask with the appropriate access rights to navigate to the app registration in the Azure Portal. You will find the app under 'Enterprise Applications' and consent to the application there. After the application has been succesfully registered and consented to you can connect to your tenant using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId [clientid] Setting up access to your own Entra ID App for App Only Access PnP PowerShell has a cmdlet that allows you to register a new Entra ID App, and optionally generate the certificates for you to use to login with that app. $result = Register-PnPEntraIDApp -ApplicationName \"PnP Rocks\" -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -OutPath c:\\mycertificates -DeviceLogin $result When you run the cmdlet above you will be asked to navigate to the shown url and enter the code shown. After that a new app will be registered in the Entra ID (make sure you have the rights to do this), and a certificate will be generated and uploaded to that app. After this a URL will be shown which you have to navigate to to provide consent for this application. By default a limited set of permissions scopes is added, but you can provide the one of the permission parameters (GraphApplicationPermissions, GraphDelegatePermissions, SharePointApplicationPermissions, SharePointDelegatePermissions) to provide your own permission scopes. It also returns the private key certificate encoded in base64 encoding. As it spans multiple lines, it is recommended to assign the outcome of Register-PnPAzureAdApp to a variable so you have access to this value more easily. The Base64 encoded private key certificate can be used in your Connect-PnPOnline voiding the need to have access to the physical file: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId [clientid] -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -CertificateBase64Encoded [pfx base64 encoded] The cmdlet will also save both the CER and PFX files to the location specified with the -Outpath parameter. The names of the files will be matching the -ApplicationName parameter, e.g. in the example above the files will be called PnP Rocks.cer and PnP Rocks.pfx. The output of the cmdlet will show the clientid. After all is set up and consent has been provided you can login using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId [clientid] -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -CertificatePath [certificate.pfx] Authenticating with Credentials Enter Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -Credentials (Get-Credential) and you will be prompted for credentials. Using this method you're required to have granted the PnP Management Shell multi-tenant application access rights. You can however register your own application using Register-PnPAzureAzureApp and then provide the -ClientId parameter with the client id/app id of your custom application. Authenticating with pre-stored credentials using the Windows Credential Manager (Windows only) Add-PnPStoredCredential -Name \"yourlabel\" -Username youruser@domain.com You will be prompted to provide a password. After that you can login using: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -Credentials \"yourlabel\" When you create the stored credentials (with Add-PnPStoredCredential or any other tool) if the Name you give it is the URL for your tenant you can omit the -Credentials parameter with Connect-PnPOnline. Using the example above create your stored credential with this command: Add-PnPStoredCredential -Name \"https://[yourtenant].sharepoint.com\" -Username youruser@contoso.com When connecting to https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com you can use this command: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com Connect-PnPOnline will look through the Windows Credential Manager for a credential matching the URL. If it finds one it will use it. It will also match that credential with deeper connection URLs like https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/IT. You can create additional stored credentials for deeper sites if you routinely connect to them with different credentials. If you want to connect with a different set of credentials you can use the -Credentials parameter to specify them. A stored credential can be used for other URLs, like the Admin site: Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant]-admin.sharepoint.com -Credentials https://[yourtenant].sharepoint.com Authenticating with pre-stored credentials using the Secrets Management Module from Microsoft (Multi-Platform) Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement -AllowPrerelease Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore -AllowPrerelease Set-SecretStoreConfiguration Set-Secret -Name \"yourlabel\" -Secret (Get-Credential) This creates a new secret vault on your computer. You will be asked to provide a password to access the vault. If you access the vault you will be prompted for that password. In case you want to want to write automated scripts you will have to turn off this password prompt as follows: Set-SecretStoreConfiguration -Authentication None For more information about these cmdlets, check out the github repositories: https://github.com/powershell/secretmanagement and https://github.com/powershell/secretstore. After you set up the vault and you added a credential Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -Credentials (Get-Secret -Name \"yourlabel\") Authentication in case you have Multi-Factor authentication enabled Connect-PnPOnline[yourtenant].sharepoint.com -Interactive This will show a popup window which will allow to authenticate and step through the multi-factor authentication flow. Authentication to GCC or National Cloud environments In order to authentication to a GCC or a national cloud environment you have to take a few steps. Notice that this will work as of release 1.3.9-nightly or later. Register your own Entra ID App You are required to register your own Entra ID App in order to authentication Register-PnPEntraIDApp -ApplicationName \"PnP PowerShell\" -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -Interactive -AzureEnvironment [USGovernment|USGovernmentHigh|USGovernmentDoD|Germany|China] -SharePointDelegatePermissions AllSites.FullControl -SharePointApplicationPermissions Sites.FullControl.All -GraphApplicationPermissions Group.ReadWrite.All -GraphDelegatePermissions Group.ReadWrite.All The AzureEnvironment parameter only allows one value. Select the correct one that matches your cloud deployment. The above statement grants a few permission scopes. You might want to add more if you want to. Alternatively, after registering the application, navigate to the Entra ID, locate the app registration, and grant more permissions and consent to them. Optionally modify the manifest for the app There is a limitation in the Entra ID for national cloud environments where you cannot select permission scopes for SharePoint Online. In order to add specific SharePoint rights you will have to manually add them to the manifest that you can edit in Entra ID: Locate the requiredResourceAccess section and add to or modify the existing entries. See the example below (notice, this is an example, do not copy and paste this as is as it will limit the permissions to only AllSites.FullControl): \"requiredResourceAccess\": [ { \"resourceAppId\": \"00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000\", \"resourceAccess\": [ { \"id\": \"56680e0d-d2a3-4ae1-80d8-3c4f2100e3d0\", \"type\": \"Scope\" } ] } You can add more permissions by using the following values: The resourceAppId for SharePoint = \"00000003-0000-0ff1-ce00-000000000000\" Permission Permission type Id Type Sites.FullControl.All Application 678536fe-1083-478a-9c59-b99265e6b0d3 Role AllSites.FullControl Delegate 56680e0d-d2a3-4ae1-80d8-3c4f2100e3d0 Scope Connect Connect-PnPOnline [yourtenant].sharepoint.com -Interactive -ClientId [clientid] -Tenant [yourtenant].onmicrosoft.com -AzureEnvironment [USGovernment|USGovernmentHigh|USGovernmentDoD|Germany|China] The AzureEnvironment parameter only allows one value. Select the correct one that matches your cloud deployment. Silent Authentication with Credentials for running in Pipelines For running Connect-PnPOnline with user credentials in Azure DevOps pipeline, you need to make sure that authentication in your Entra ID application is configured to allow public client. Public client can be configured from the Azure portal from the Authentication Blade in the application or by setting the allowPublicClient property in the application's manifest to true. username and password for service account can be stored as secret pipeline variables and can be referenced in the script to achieve complete automation. Silent Authentication with Credentials and MFA for running in Azure DevOps Pipelines with Microsoft Hosted Agents Identify the possible IP ranges for Microsoft-hosted agents Identify the region for your organization in Organization settings. Identify the Azure Geography for your organization's region. Map the names of the regions in your geography to the format used in the weekly file, following the format of AzureCloud., such as AzureCloud.westus. You can map the names of the regions from the Azure Geography list to the format used in the weekly file. You can find the weekly IP file at the following URL: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=56519 For example, if your organization is located in the South East Asia region, you would map it to the format AzureCloud.SouthEastAsia. Create a named location in Entra ID conditional access Go to Entra ID conditional access Open named location blade, click on + IP Ranges Location Enter the IP ranges for Microsoft Hosted Agents, Mark as trusted location should be checked. Create a conditional access policy Go to Entra ID conditional access, click on +New Policy. Give a meaningful name, click on Users and Groups -> Include select users and groups, select the user with which you want to run your pipeline. Include all cloud apps. Under conditions -> locations include any locations and exclude the recently created named location. Under grant -> choose grant access. Only require multifactor authentication needs to be checked. Enable the policy and click on Save. Important You need to make sure that the new policy does not conflicts with any other policy in your tenant, otherwise make the changes accordingly. Powershell script to be run in pipeline $creds = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential -ArgumentList ($username, $password) Connect-PnPOnline -Url <site url> -Credentials $creds -ClientId <Application/Client ID of Entra ID app>"

Click on Add a module at the top of the screen Choose from the following options: Specific stable version Important Currently stable PnP PowerShell version that works with Azure Automation 7.2 Runbooks is 2.1.1. If you would like to use a latest nightly build instead, use the below instructions Select Browse from gallery, Runtime version 7.2 (preview) and click on the Click here to browse from gallery link Search for PnP PowerShell and select the first result. Click on Select to confirm. Click on Import to start the download and importing process. It will take up to 10 minutes for the import to complete. You can check the import status by changing the Module type filter to Custom. Once it's done, it will show the status Available Latest prerelease version If you wish to use the latest prerelease/nightly build version, open up a PowerShell 7 console and execute: Save-Module PnP.PowerShell -AllowPrerelease -Path c:\\temp Using Windows File Explorer, go to the folder where you downloaded the PnP PowerShell package. You should see a folder called PnP.PowerShell in there. Right click on it and choose the option Compress to ZIP file. Select Browse for file, Runtime version 7.2 (preview) and click on the folder icon next to Powershell module file and select the zipped up PnP.PowerShell.zip file generated in the previous step.

Once it's done, it will show the status Available Decide how you want to authenticate in your Azure Automation Runbooks By using a Managed Identity The recommended option is to use a managed identity in Azure to allow your Azure Automation Runbook to connect to Microsoft Graph or SharePoint Online using PnP PowerShell. Using this method, you specifically grant permissions for your Azure Runbook to access these permissions, without having any client secret or certificate pair that potentially could fall into wrong hands. This makes this option the most secure option by far. Since version 1.11.95-nightly, Managed Identities are both supported against SharePoint Online as well as Microsoft Graph cmdlets. Before this version, only Microsoft Graph was being supported. Enabling the managed identity for an Azure Automation Runbook In your Azure Automation account, in the left menu, go to Identity under Account Settings Ensure you are on the System assigned tab and flip the switch for Status to On, if not already done Click the Save button and confirm your action in the dialog box that will be shown A new entry will now automatically be created in your Azure Active Directory for this app having the same name as your Azure Function and the Object (principal) ID shown on this page. Take notice of the Object (principal) ID. We will need it in the next section to assign permissions to. Assigning permissions to the managed identity Next step is to assign permissions to this managed identity so it is authorized to access the Microsoft Graph and/or SharePoint Online. If you don't know which permissions exist yet, you can use the below sample to get a list of all available permissions: Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipal -BuiltInType MicrosoftGraph | Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAvailableAppRole Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipal -BuiltInType SharePointOnline | Get-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAvailableAppRole Once you know which permissions you would like to assign, you can use the below samples. Note that the Principal requires the object Id (not the application/client id) or the application name. Add-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAppRole -Principal \"62614f96-cb78-4534-bf12-1f6693e8237c\" -AppRole \"Group.Read.All\" -BuiltInType MicrosoftGraph Add-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAppRole -Principal \"mymanagedidentity\" -AppRole \"Sites.FullControl.All\" -BuiltInType SharePointOnline Create a Runbook We're now ready to create a Runbook in which your PnP PowerShell script will run.

    "keywords": "Using PnP PowerShell in Azure Cloud Shell In this article we will explain how to use PnP PowerShell inside Azure Cloud Shell. Using Azure Cloud Shell can come in handy in several scenarios. For example if policies on your local machine block you from installing PowerShell modules, you're behind a proxy which causes problems for your requests or you're on a shared machine which you don't want to pollute. With Azure Cloud Shell you open a PowerShell session which runs within Azure and outputs to you through i.e. a normal web browser via shell.azure.com, Windows Terminal or using any of the growing numbers of locations throughout the Microsoft products where the Azure Cloud Shell icon is visible (Microsoft 365 Admin Center, Teams Admin Center, Azure Portal, etc.). Requirements You need to have access to an Azure Subscription. The usage of Azure Cloud Shell itself is free, however it requires an Azure File Share with Storage Account behind it to store files, which is billed against normal rates. A Visual Studio subscription with Azure Benefits is ideal to use for this. Set up Azure Cloud Shell If you haven't used Azure Cloud Shell yet, follow these steps to get it going: Open a web browser and go to https://shell.azure.com Follow the steps on the screen. When asked to choose between Bash or PowerShell, choose PowerShell. When asked to create a new storage account, use the default or go for advanced if you wish to specify the names of the components yourself. Once done, you should be seeing a blue PowerShell like environment running from your browser. Add PnP PowerShell to your Azure Cloud Shell After completing the steps of the previous paragraph to get Azure Cloud Shell set up for your account, you can now add PnP PowerShell to your environment. You only need to do this once. Every time you return to Azure Cloud Shell, it will still have the module available to be used. You still have to manually update it to a newer version of PnP PowerShell, once one will be released, though, just like locally. In the Azure Cloud Shell, on the prompt, enter Install-Module PnP.PowerShell -AllowPrerelease If asked to confirm that you wish to install the module from an untrusted repository, respond with Y Connecting to your Microsoft 365 Environment from Azure Cloud Shell Not every available option within PnP PowerShell to authenticate will work due to the Azure Cloud Shell not being able to show a visual login screen. Choose below how you will authenticate. By using Device Login Using the Device Login option will allow you to use any browser session on any device to authenticate your Azure Cloud Shell connection attempt. Follow these steps to do so. In Azure Cloud Shell, enter: Connect-PnPOnline https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com -DeviceLogin Open a web browser on any device and navigate to https://microsoft.com/devicelogin Type over or copy/paste the code shown in the yellow area of the Azure Cloud Shell Log in with the account you wish to connect the Azure Cloud Shell with to your Microsoft 365 environment Click on Continue to confirm you are logging on to the PnP Management Shell You can now safely close the browser you have used to perform the device login Return to the Azure Cloud Shell. If it shows the prompt again, you have successfully been signed in to your Microsoft 365 tenant and can now perform PnP PowerShell cmdlets like you're used to. Important There is one final important remark to make. When connecting using the -DeviceLogin option, PnP PowerShell cannot automatically switch to the yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com context, meaning any cmdlets you try to run that require being connected to the admin portal, will need you to use Connect-PnPOnline https://yourtenant-admin.sharepoint.com -DeviceLogin yourself first to authenticate specifically to the admin site before you can use them. By using a Managed Identity Important The current versions of PnP PowerShell and Azure Cloud Shell do not support Managed Identity authentication. This is a known issue and we are working on a solution. In the meantime, you can use the Device Login option to authenticate to your Microsoft 365 environment."

    "keywords": "Using PnP PowerShell in Azure Functions In this article we will setup an Azure Function to use PnP PowerShell Important Notice that the Azure Function scripts in this article run in a separate thread/job. We do this because of possible conflicts between assemblies of already loaded PowerShell modules and PnP PowerShell (for instance, the Az cmdlets that get loaded by default use some of the same assemblies as PnP PowerShell but in different versions which can cause conflicts). By running the script in a separate thread we will not have these conflicts. If PnP PowerShell is the only module currently being used and loaded in your Azure Function you don't need the Start-ThreadJob construct and you can simply write the script as usual. Create the Azure Function App As the UI in the Azure Portal changes every now and then, but the principles stay the same, follow the following steps: Go to the Azure Portal and login with your Azure credentials Create a new Function App using the Create a resource button and searching for Function App or use this direct link to locate it Choose runtime stack PowerShell Core and version 7.2 (7.0 is not longer an option as of December 3rd, 2022) Select Windows as the operating system or else you will not be able to perform the following steps from your browser. Complete the creation of the Azure Function Once the resource has been created, click on Go to resource to open the Azure Function Configure the Azure Function Now your Azure Function has been created, proceed with the next paragraphs to configure it for using PnP PowerShell. Disable the Azure cmdlets in the Azure Function The Azure Function comes with the Azure cmdlets pre-installed. If you don't need them, you can disable them to save some memory and processing time. It will also avoid version conflicts with PnP PowerShell, so it is highly recommended to disable them. Navigate to App files which is located the left side menu of the function app under the Functions header. To disable the Az cmdlets, save and edit the profile.psd file. Mark out the following block in the file as follows, if not already done: # if ($env:MSI_SECRET) { # Disable-AzContextAutosave -Scope Process | Out-Null # Connect-AzAccount -Identity # } Save the profile.ps1 file. If you don't do this and enable a managed identity on the Azure Function, it will throw an exception. Make PnP PowerShell available to all functions in the Azure function App Navigate to App files which is located the left side menu of the function app under the Functions header. In the dropdown presented near the top, select requirements.psd1. You'll notice that the function app wants to provide the Azure cmdlets. If you do not need those, keep the Az entry presented commented out. Add a new entry or replace the whole contents of the file with one of the following and remember to save the requirements.psd1 file: Specific stable version Important PnP PowerShell version 2 or later is required for this to work @{ 'PnP.PowerShell' = '2.2.0' } The version that will be installed will be the specified specific build, which is generally recommended. You build and test your Azure Function against this specific PnP PowerShell version. Future releases may work differently and cause issues, therefore it is generally recommended to specify a specific version here. Latest stable version Important PnP PowerShell version 2 or later is required for this to work If, for some reason, you would like to ensure it is always using the latest available PnP PowerShell version, you can also specify a wildcard in the version (not recommended): @{ 'PnP.PowerShell' = '2.*' } This will then automatically download any minor version of the major 1 release when available. Note that wildcards will always take the latest stable version and not the nightly build/prerelease versions. Specific prerelease version If you wish to use a specific prerelease/nightly build version, go to the overview of available versions and literally copy/paste the version in the definition, i.e.: @{ 'PnP.PowerShell' = '2.2.130-nightly' } Decide how you want to authenticate in your Azure Function By using a Managed Identity The recommended option is to use a managed identity in Azure to allow your Azure Function to connect to Microsoft Graph or SharePoint Online using PnP PowerShell.

Add-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAppRole -Principal \"62614f96-cb78-4534-bf12-1f6693e8237c\" -AppRole \"Group.Read.All\" -BuiltInType MicrosoftGraph Add-PnPAzureADServicePrincipalAppRole -Principal \"mymanagedidentity\" -AppRole \"Sites.FullControl.All\" -BuiltInType SharePointOnline Create the Azure Function for managed identity authentication Create a new function and replace the function code with the following example: using namespace System.Net param($Request, $TriggerMetadata) Connect-PnPOnline -ManagedIdentity Get-PnPMicrosoft365Group Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{ StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK }) Notice the super clean and simple Connect-PnPOnline. Nothing that could fall into wrong hands, no client secret or certificate that could expire. Based on the permissions assigned to the managed identity, it will be able to authenticate and authorize access to the Microsoft Graph APIs used behind the cmdlet to fetch the data. By using a certificate Create your certificate In this following example we create a new Azure AD Application registration which creates your certificates. You can also use a private/public certificate key pair you already have. $password = Read-Host -Prompt \"Enter certificate password\" -AsSecureString Register-PnPAzureADApp -ApplicationName \"MyDemoApp\" -Tenant [yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com] -CertificatePassword $password -Interactive You will be asked to authenticate. Log in using an account that has the permissions to create an app registration in your Azure Active Directory. After logging in, the following actions will automatically be taken: An app registration will be created using the provided name A self signed certificate will be generated which includes a pfx and a cer file (private/public key pair) The public key of the certificate (cer) will be configured as a valid certificate to authenticate with for the app registration A basic set of permissions will be assigned to the app registration. These can freely be changed at will at a later time. Admin consent will be given to the given set of permissions Make a note of the clientid shown and proceed with the steps in the following section. Apply your certificate Once you have an Azure Active Directory application set up and the public key certificate uploaded to its registration, proceed with configuring the Azure Function to make use of the private key of this certificate pair: In your function app, navigate to Certificates under Settings, switch to the Bring your own certificates (.pfx) section and click on Add certificate. In the panel that appears from the side, select Upload certificate (.pfx) and select the \"MyDemoApp.pfx\" file that has been created for you in the Create your certificate step above. Enter the password you used when creating the certificate. The certificate friendly name can be anything you would like. After the certificate has been uploaded, copy the thumbprint value shown. Navigate to Configuration, ensure you are on the Application settings tab and click on New application setting Call the setting WEBSITE_LOAD_CERTIFICATES and set the thumbprint as a value. To make all the certificates you uploaded available use * as the value. See https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/configure-ssl-certificate-in-code for more information. Click on OK at the bottom and then on Save at the top. Click Continue to confirm your changes. Create the Azure Function for certificate authentication Create a new function and replace the function code with the following example: using namespace System.Net # Input bindings are passed in via param block. param($Request, $TriggerMetadata) # Write to the Azure Functions log stream. Write-Host \"PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request.\" $script = { Connect-PnPOnline tenant.sharepoint.com/sites/demo -ClientId [the clientid created earlier] -Thumbprint [the thumbprint you copied] -Tenant [tenant.onmicrosoft.com] $web = Get-PnPWeb $web.Title } $webTitle = Start-ThreadJob -Script $script | Receive-Job -Wait $body = \"The title of the web is $($webTitle)\" # Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'. Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{ StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK Body = $body }) By using Credentials This method is not recommended as it requires you to have an account without MFA of which its credentials will be stored in Azure. Create your credentials Navigate to Configuration under Settings and create a new Application Setting. Enter tenant_user and enter the username you want to authenticate with as the user Enter tenant_pwd and enter the password you want to use for that user Create the function Create a new function and replace the function code with following example: using namespace System.Net # Input bindings are passed in via param block. param($Request, $TriggerMetadata) # Write to the Azure Functions log stream.

    "keywords": "Batching in PnP PowerShell Some cmdlets support batching, but there are a few things to point out here. Let me first explain the difference between a normal request and a batched request. Adding items without batching (CSOM) 1..100 | ForEach-Object{ Add-PnPListItem -List \"ItemTest\" -Values @{\"Title\" = \"Test Item $_\"} } If you add a list item with Add-PnPListItem without batching, the following happens behind the scenes: We retrieve the list and make sure we retrieve all the fields used in that list. (a least one request to the server but usually a few more CSOM requests) We add a new item to the list We loop through the values you specified to set on the item and depending on the type of field we format the value ready to be added to the item (this can introduce additional CSOM requests in the case of taxonomy fields for instance) We update the item (this will be a CSOM request to the server) All in all you see we make around 6 requests, although the exact number depends a bit on what type of fields you are setting. So if you loop through 100 items, you get at least 600 requests. Adding an item with batching (REST) $batch = New-PnPBatch 1..100 | ForEach-Object{ Add-PnPListItem -List \"ItemTest\" -Values @{\"Title\"=\"Test Item Batched $_\"} -Batch $batch } Invoke-PnPBatch -Batch $batch When you use batching, these number of requests are much lower. This is what happens when you use batching We retrieve the list and make sure we retrieve all the fields used in that list. We then, and that's important, add that list to a cache in the batch. That means that every subsequent request for the fields of that list will be coming from the cache. We loop through the values you specified to set on the item. This most of the time does not cause any additional request, with the exception of taxonomy fields. Due to limitations of the REST apis available to use we have to fallback to a CSOM request to format the value. We add the item with the new values to the list (creating a batched request) This means that for every new item there is one request + a few initial request to retrieve the list. Then when you execute Invoke-Batch we will check out how many items there are in the batch and will split them up accordingly to follow the request limits provided. You'll see that large batches are split up in chunks of 100 requests. This means that if you, say add 100 items, you will issue around 6 requests in total. Large batches and exceptions Depending on the type of requests you are making batches can be split up in 'chunks'. For instance, if the tasks you perform are towards SharePoint and behind the scenes use the REST api of SharePoint a batch larger then 100 requests will be split up in chunks of 100 requests. When behind the scenes the Microsoft Graph is being called then the batch requests will be split up in chunks of 20 requests. For instance, removing 520 list items will result in 6 separate requests, the first 5 containing 100 remove requests, the last one containing 20 remove requests. If during one of these chunks an exception occurs (for instance you are trying to delete an item that does not exist), by default we will continue processing the remaining batch chunks. If you want to stop processing these remaining batches immediately after an exception occurs, use the -StopOnException switch on Invoke-PnPBatch cmdlet. Cmdlets that support batching The following cmdlets support batching. (This support began with the 1.7.63-nightly release.) All cmdlets which support batching display the badge, linking to this article.

    "keywords": "Connecting with PnP PowerShell PnP PowerShell offers many ways to connect to an environment. This page provides guidance on the various options you have and how they can be used against which environment(s). Connect using credentials In order to connect with credentials you have two options: Connect by using the PnP Management Shell Multi-Tenant Entra ID Application Important This cmdlet will stop working on the 9th of September of 2024. Register your own Entra ID application instead. See lower in this article for more information. You will have to consent / register the PnP Management Shell Multi-Tenant Azure AD Application in your own tenant: Register-PnPManagementShellAccess This will launch a device login flow that will ask you to consent to the application. Notice that is only required -once- per tenant. You will need to have appropriate access rights to be able to consent applications in your Azure AD. After that you can authenticate using Connect-PnPOnline [tenant].sharepoint.com -Credentials (Get-Credential) or in case the account you would like to use has MFA or any other authentication provider configured for it, instead use: Connect-PnPOnline [tenant].sharepoint.com -Interactive Connect by using your own Entra ID Application for Interactive Login You will have to create your own Entra ID Application registration, or you can create one: Register-PnPEntraIDAppForInteractiveLogin -ApplicationName \"YourApplicationName\" -Tenant [tenant].onmicrosoft.com -Interactive This will launch an authentication dialog where you need to authenticate. After closing this window the cmdlet will continue to register a new application with a set of default permissions, after which you will be asked to provide consent. Notice that you will asked to login again for this. You can add permissions by using the -GraphApplicationPermissions, -GraphDelegatePermissions, -SharePointApplicationPermissions or -SharePointDelegatePermissions parameters. The cmdlet will output the Azure AppId/client id. After the application has been created, and you consented to the permissions requested, the cmdlet will show the id of the app. You can then connect to your tenant using: Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://[tenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId <id of app created> Connect-PnPOnline -Url [tenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId [clientid] Connect by using your own Entra ID Application for AppOnly Login You will have to create your own Entra ID Application registration, or you can create one: Register-PnPEntraIDApp -ApplicationName \"YourApplicationName\" -Tenant [tenant].onmicrosoft.com -Interactive This will launch an authentication dialog where you need to authenticate. After closing this window the cmdlet will continue to register a new application with a set of default permissions. By default a certificate will be generated and stored in the current folder, named after the application you want to create. You can specify your own certificate by using the -CertificatePath parameter and optional -CertificatePassword parameter. You can add permissions by using the -GraphApplicationPermissions, -GraphDelegatePermissions, -SharePointApplicationPermissions or -SharePointDelegatePermissions parameters. The cmdlet will output the Azure AppId/client id, the name and location of the certificates created (if any) and the thumbprint of the certificate. It is possible to add the certificate created to the certificate management store in Windows by adding the -Store parameter. Note if you are using Credential Based Authentication, you will need to make a change to the app registration manifest file. Go to the app registration, select Manifest under the Manage section, then change the \"allowPublicClient\" property to true and click save. Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://[tenant].sharepoint.com -Credentials (Get-Credential) -ClientId [clientid] Connect using a ClientId and PFX certificate stored on your local machine Allows using an Azure Entra ID app registration from your own Azure Entra ID with a certificate to connect. The private key certificate, typically the .pfx file, should be accessible on your local machine. The following will generate an Entra ID Application registration and create a certificate containing a public and private key. Register-PnPEntraIDApp -ApplicationName \"PnPPowerShell\" -Tenant [tenant].onmicrosoft.com -Password (ConvertTo-SecureString -String \"password\" -AsPlainText -Force) You will be asked to authenticate. After that the cmdlet will generate two files, PnPPowerShell.pfx and PnPPowerShell.cer and a new Entra ID Application will be registered with the specified name. The public key/CER file will be uploaded and registered with the newly create application registration. You will have to use the .pfx file to connect. Notice that the Register-PnPEntraIDApp cmdlet only has to be executed once per tenant/application. Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://[tenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId [clientid] -Tenant [tenant].onmicrosoft.com -CertificatePath '.\\PnPPowerShell.pfx' -CertificatePassword (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText -Force \"password\") Connect using a ClientId and PFX certificate stored in the Windows Certificate Management Store Allows using an Azure Entra ID app registration from your own Azure Entra ID with a certificate to connect. The private key certificate, typically the .pfx file, should be accessible on your local machine in the Certificate Management Store. The following will generate an Entra ID Application registration and create a certificate containing a public and private key which will be stored for the current user in the Windows Certificate Management Store. $password = ConvertTo-SecureString -String \"password\" -AsPlainText -Force Register-PnPEntraIDApp -ApplicationName \"PnPPowerShell\" -Tenant [tenant].onmicrosoft.com -Store CurrentUser You will be asked to authenticate. After that the cmdlet will generate a certificate and will store it in the Windows Certificate Management Store and a new Entra ID Application will be registered with the specified name. The public key of the certificate file will be uploaded and registered with the newly create application registration. Notice that the Register-PnPEntraIDApp cmdlet only has to be executed once per tenant/application. The output of the cmdlet contains the thumbprint to use. Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://[tenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId [clientid] -Tenant [tenant].onmicrosoft.com -Thumbprint $thumbprint Connect using a ClientId and PFX certificate being Base64 encoded In some scenarios it might be easier to have the PFX file being encoded as a string using Base64 as opposed to having to store the physical PFX file somewhere. If you have the PFX encoded using Base64 encoding, you can connect using: Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://[tenant].sharepoint.com -ClientId [clientid] -Tenant [tenant].onmicrosoft.com -CertificateBase64Encoded $encodedPfx If you wish to convert a PFX file to its Base64 encoded equivalent, you can use: $bytes = Get-Content '.\\PnPPowerShell.pfx' -AsByteStream $encodedPfx = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes) Connect to a National Cloud Deployment (GCC/Germany/China) If you are on a National Cloud instance, read the authentication article for more information"

However, in order to automate authentication you need to safely store these credentials. You should -never- store them in your scripts.

Install the required modules Install-Module -Name \"Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement\" Install-Module -Name \"Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore\" Configuring the vault After installing the module, create and register a vault: Register-SecretVault -Name \"SecretStore\" -ModuleName \"Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore\" -DefaultVault Set-SecretStoreConfiguration -Authentication None The last cmdlet, where you set the authentication to None means that you will allow access to the secret store without requiring you to enter a password to unlock the vault. This is optional. Notice that you will be asked several times to provide a password the moment you create a new vault. If you intend to use the native out of the box functionality of PnP PowerShell with the Secret Management modules, notice that the authentication is required to set to None.

Notice that a URL like https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/demo will also match the secret. You can create multiple secrets too. PnP PowerShell will then try to match the most complete label first, e.g. a secret ending on /sites/demo1 will proceed the one without that ending.

In this way it is also easier to make sure that all members of the project are using the same development environment, with the same versions of the prerequisites installed. If you want to learn more about this Visual Studio Code feature, you can start here. Prerequisites There might be two options of using Visual Studio Code development containers with PnP.PowerShell: Using locally installed Docker, on your desktop/laptop. Running containers in cloud using GitHub CodeSpaces (requires a paid GitHub plan) When you run in a development container in GitHub CodeSpaces, you do NOT need to install any version of the PnP.PowerShell directly on your laptop/desktop. What you will need locally is only Visual Studio Code! Locally Installed Docker For using that option you need to have locally installed the following software: Visual Studio Code Visual Studio Code extension, Remote - Containers Docker Engine. Kindly use Installing Docker locally section of the Using PnP PowerShell in Docker containers article for installation instructions. GitHub CodeSpaces This option requires the following: Git repository in a GitHub organization with enabled CodeSpaces Defining Development Containers for the Project In the root folder of the source code, create the folder called .devcontainer. In this folder, create the devcontainer.json file with the following contents: { \"name\": \"PnP 2.4.0\", \"image\": \"m365pnp/powershell:2.4.0-alpine-3.16.5\", \"customizations\": { \"vscode\": { \"settings\": { \"terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.linux\": \"pwsh\" }, \"extensions\": [ \"ms-vscode.powershell\" ] } }, \"extensions\": [ \"editorconfig.editorconfig\", \"dbaeumer.vscode-eslint\", \"ms-vscode.PowerShell\" ], \"postCreateCommand\": \"apk add git; git config --global --add safe.directory /workspaces\" } Starting working with PnP.PowerShell when you run Docker locally Open the folder in Visual Studio Code Click in the bottom left corner: Select Reopen in Container: Open a new Visual Studio terminal and run Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://<your-tenant-name>.sharepoint.com The command should work even if you don't have PnP.PowerShell module installed locally on your laptop. Starting working with PnP.PowerShell when you run containers remotely in GitHub CodeSpaces Open the project in GitHub site. Click Code button: Click Create codespace on ... button: Run Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://<your-tenant-name>.sharepoint.com in the Visual Studio Code terminal The command should work even if you don't have PnP.PowerShell module installed locally on your laptop."

    "keywords": "Using PnP PowerShell in Docker containers Using Docker allows you to use any software inside virtual environments, without having to install this software directly on your laptop or server. These virtual environments are containers, which might be imagined as lightweight virtual machines. Having their own virtual disks, memory and processes, containers are rationally isolated from your laptop operating system, providing you a great way of experimenting and using any version of PnP.PowerShell without installing it. The good news is that you will not even need to install PnP.PowerShell in containers by your own: PnP team is already publishing Docker container images for each supported and nightly release, here. You will however need to install docker runtime. If you use Windows, we would recommend you using Linux containers with help of WSL. Alternatively, even though it is not the most common way, you might want to run PnP.PowerShell in Windows containers. Mind you that some use cases might be limited when using Windows containers. If you use Mac OS or Linux, the easiest way is to use Linux containers. Play with PnP.PowerShell online You can try using m365pnp/powershell Docker containers online, without installing anything on your desktop/laptop. Open https://labs.play-with-docker.com/ Login Click Start Click + ADD NEW INSTANCE Run in the online console: docker run --rm -it m365pnp/powershell After that you can start running commands like Connect-PnPOnline. Installing Docker locally Mac OS: Install brew install --cask docker Launch Docker: Press ⌘ + Space to bring up Spotlight Search and enter Docker to launch Docker.

Linux/WSL/Mac OS: docker run --rm -it m365pnp/powershell Windows (run in PowerShell console): docker run --rm -it m365pnp/powershell:1.10.0-nanoserver-1809 After that you can start running commands like Connect-PnPOnline. Mind you that in the case above, the container will have an isolated disk system so the commands that you run inside the container will not be able to access files from your host machine. However, sometimes you might want to run a script or use some files from your host OS (for example, when you have a ps1 file in a git repository that you cloned to your laptop). In this case you will need to mount a directory on your host as a volume inside the container. See the following examples. Linux/WSL/Mac OS: docker run --rm -it -v \"$(pwd):/home\" -w /home m365pnp/powershell Windows (run in PowerShell console): docker run --rm -it -v \"${pwd}:C:\\workplace\" -w C:\\workplace m365pnp/powershell:1.10.0-nanoserver-1809 In such container you can run Get-ChildItem and see the contents of the current directory. The examples above start new container and allow you to interactively use container, running inline commands. In other cases however, you might want to just start a container for a short time (a few seconds maybe) and run a ps1 script unattended and then automatically terminate the container. Here is how you can do it. Linux/WSL/Mac OS: docker run --rm -v \"$(pwd):/home\" -w /home m365pnp/powershell pwsh test.ps1 Windows (run in PowerShell console): docker run --rm -v \"${pwd}:C:\\workplace\" -w C:\\workplace m365pnp/powershell:1.10.0-nanoserver-1809 pwsh test.ps1 Finally, your scripts might have parametrization so that you can run the same code in different cases/environments. This is the way to provide variable values. Linux/WSL/Mac OS: ParameterValue=\"test\" docker run --rm -v \"$(pwd):/home\" -w /home m365pnp/powershell pwsh -c \"./test.ps1 -Parameter1 $ParameterValue\" Windows (run in PowerShell console): $ParameterValue=\"test\" docker run --rm -v \"${pwd}:C:\\workplace\" -w C:\\workplace m365pnp/powershell:1.10.0-nanoserver-1809 pwsh -c \"./test.ps1 -Parameter1 $ParameterValue\" Please see Docker documentation to see arguments for docker run command.

This guidance should help you getting started contributing to PnP PowerShell by just following some easy steps. There are various ways to accomplish the same goal. We'll go through a process here that should be easy to follow and accomplish for anyone. If you prefer using other tools over the ones mentioned here, such as using the cloning feature within Visual Studio, of course, feel free to use that instead. Getting started Follow the paragraphs below to get yourself started with contributing to PnP PowerShell. Installing Git Tools We'll be using the command line Git Tools to complete the steps. If you prefer using other tools, such as Visual Studio or the desktop client of Git, feel free to use that instead. If you haven't got them already, install the Git Tools for your environment. They're available for Windows, Linux and Mac. Simply download the latest installer from: https://git-scm.com/downloads And click on the Click here to download link There will be a scary amount of questions asked during the installer. Just use all defaults and next-next-finish through the installation process Installing PowerShell 7 PnP PowerShell only runs on PowerShell 7. If you don't have it installed yet, follow the steps below to install it. If you already have it installed, you can skip to the next paragraph. Navigate to the PowerShell 7 download page and download the latest version of PowerShell 7. It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac. You can accept all the defaults and just do a next-next-finish installation. Installing the .NET SDK 6 To be able to compile the PnP PowerShell code, you need to have the .NET SDK 6 installed. If you don't have it installed yet, follow the steps below to install it. If you already have it installed, you can skip to the next paragraph. Navigate to the .NET SDK 6 download page and download the latest version of the .NET SDK 6. It is available for Windows, Linux and Mac.

Basically it means you will get your own copy of the sourcecode. To do so, follow the steps below. Go to the PnP PowerShell repository on GitHub Make sure you're logged on to GitHub. If you dont have a GitHub account yet, create one and log on first before you continue. Click the Fork button in the top right corner of the page or use this direct link instead If it shows you a notice like this, you already have a fork. Continue with the next paragraph. If it instead shows something like this, click on Create fork to create your own fork. You can leave all the defaults. Updating your Fork Now that you have your own fork, you need to make sure it's up to date with the latest changes from the main repository. Do this every time before you start working on a change. If you don't do so, it will become much harder for us to review and merge your changes. To update your fork, follow the steps below. First identify if your fork is already up to date. If it is, it will show you a message like this and you're good to continue with the next paragraph. If it instead shows something like this, showing that you're a certain amount of commits behind on pnp:dev, you need to update your fork first by continueing with the next step. Click on the Sync fork button and in the flyout that appears click on Update branch It should now show the above message that your branch is up to date. You can now continue with the next paragraph. If it instead shows that you're a certain number of comits ahead, it means your dev branch got polluted by changes you have pushed to it and you need to reset it first. Read up under Troubleshooting for more information on how to resolve this situation. Cloning the repository to your local file system The next step is to download, or clone, your copy/fork of the repository to your local machine so you can work on updating it. Follow these steps to do so. Open a command prompt or PowerShell window and navigate to the folder where you want to clone the repository to. For example, if you want to clone it to your C:\\Source folder, you would do the following: cd C:\\Source Look up the URL of your fork. You can find it by clicking on the Code button on your forked repository on GitHub In the command prompt or PowerShell window, type the following command and replace the URL with the URL of your fork: git clone <URL of repository> It may be that it asks you to log on to GitHub. If so, do so and it will continue with the clone. You should now have a copy of the PnP PowerShell code on your local machine in the subfolder named similarly to your fork name, typically powershell. If you want to read up on an explanation what each of these folders are for, read the folder structure article. Add a reference to the upstream repository. This will allow you to pull in changes from the main repository to your local copy. To do so, type the command below. This time you can execute it exactly as shown here, you don't need to replace it with the URL of your own repository. git remote add upstream https://github.com/pnp/powershell.git You can validate if the upstream has been added successfully by executing: git remote -v If it shows entries for upstream, it worked. Making changes to the code You are now ready to start making changes to the code! Use your favorite code editor to make changes to the code. If you don't have a favorite code editor yet, we recommend you use Visual Studio Code. It's free, open source and cross platform. It's also the editor some of us use ourselves. You can also use the full version of Visual Studio. The next steps will assume Visual Studio Code has been installed and will be used. Open Visual Studio Code and using the File menu go to Open Folder... Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository to and select the folder named powershell. Click Select Folder to open the folder in Visual Studio Code. If a dialog pops up asking if you trust the authors of the files in the folder, click Yes, I trust the authors. Before starting to make changes, to avoid polution your dev branch as it needs to stay up to date with the PnP PowerShell dev branch, create a new branch for your changes. To do so, click on dev at the bottom left and in the flyout menu that appears on the top, click on Create new branch... Enter any name for the new branch you would like. It helps giving it a distinctive name that makes it easy to identify the changes you're making. For example, if you're going to be working on a new cmdlet which allows to retrieve sites, you could name it RetrieveFilesCmdlet. Hit enter to create the new branch. At the bottom left of Visual Studio Code, it should now show the new branch name you have created. You're now good to go and start making your changes to the code. Once you're done making your changes, proceed with the next paragraph on how to test your changes. Some hints on how to work with Visual Studio Code to find the files in PnP PowerShell more easily: Use CTRL+P to easily search for existing files. If you're looking for an existing cmdlet to update, you can type its name without -PnP to find it easily. I.e. for Get-PnPSite, type GetSite and it will show you the file where the cmdlet is defined. You can then open that file by hitting enter and make your changes. You can also use CTRL+P to easily search for existing documentation on cmdlets. This time you will enter the full cmdlet name to find the documentation. I.e. for Get-PnPSite, type Get-PnPSite and it will show you the file where the documentation for the cmdlet is defined. You can then open that file by hitting enter and make your changes. Its easier to copy than to reinvent! If you're going to add a new cmdlet, look for one that does something close to what you want to do and make a copy of it to function as a starter. You can then rename the cmdlet and update the code to do what you want it to do. Please only submit one (type of) change per pull request. If you want to submit multiple changes, please submit them as separate pull requests. This makes it easier for us to review, understand and merge your changes. Testing your changes If you have only updated documentation, so called .md files, there's no need to test your changes. Just read up on your changes once more to ensure there are no typos. If you have updated code, you need to test your changes to make sure they work as expected. To do so, you need to build the code and then test your changes. Follow these steps to do so. Ensure you do not have any PowerShell window open on your machine in which you have loaded PnP PowerShell. If you do, close them all before proceeding. In Visual Studio Code, hit CTRL+SHIFT+B to open the build menu. In the menu that appears on the top, choose the option Build with nugets. In the terminal window that appears at the bottom, you should see the build process start. It might take a few minutes to complete. Once it's done, you should see a message that the build succeeded. Be sure that it shows Build succeeded and no errors around copying the files to your local PowerShell modules folder. If it instead shows an error like the one below, it means you still have a PowerShell session open somewhere your machine which has PnP PowerShell loaded and which blocks the build process to update the files. It can be frustrating at times to find the PowerShell session that is blocking the build process. If you're not sure which session is blocking the build process, you can try to close all PowerShell sessions and try again. If that doesn't work, you can try restarting Visual Studio Code. If it you get the error \"Path to shell executable \"pwsh.exe\" does not exist\", open tasks.json file and change executable path \"pwsh.exe\" to the full path of your \"C:\\Program Files\\PowerShell\\7\\pwsh.exe\". You can now use PnP PowerShell as normal, but this time it will use your own build instead of the official PnP PowerShell build. To test your changes, you can use the cmdlets you have created or updated. Ensure you will use a PowerShell 7 session and not a PowerShell 5 session. If you wish to step through your code debugging it, in your PowerShell 7 window, type the following command to reveal the process ID it runs under: $PID Back in Visual Studio Code, hit F5 If it asks you to install the coreclr component, follow these steps. In Visual Studio Code, at the top a flyout menu should appear with the currently running processes on your machine. Start typing in the process ID you revealed in the step above and select the process that matches your PowerShell 7 session. Note that this does not work if you have installed PowerShell 7 through the Microsoft Store. If that's the case, uninstall it again from your Windows start menu by right clicking on PowerShell 7 and choosing Uninstall and reinstall PowerShell 7 using any of the other options. You can now set breakpoints as you are used to in your code and use the PowerShell 7 session you connected to to run the cmdlet and hit the breakpoints you have set. Submitting your changes for review Once you're done making and testing your changes, you need to submit them for review and submission in what we call a Pull Request, or PR in short. Follow these steps to do so. Within Visual Studio Code, go to the Source Control section on the left. You will see all of the changes you have made. Once again, ensure with the branch name at the bottom, in this case MyAwesomeUpdate that you are working off of your own branch and not the dev branch. Enter a meaningful commit message in which you very briefly describe what you have changed. Then click the Commit button to commit your changes. If Visual Studio Code shows a dialog mentioning that there are no staged changes to commit, just proceed by clicking Yes or Always based on your personal preference. If Visual Studio Code shows a dialog mentioning Make sure you configure your \"user.name\" and \"user.email\" in git., follow these steps. Now click the Publish Branch option that should appear under the Source Control section of Visual Studio Code to push your branch to GitHub. If it asks for the remote to publish it to, pick Origin. Open your browser and go to the PnP PowerShell repository on GitHub. You should see a message that you have pushed a new branch to your fork. Click the Compare & pull request button to proceed. Provide a meaningful title for your pull request and a description that explains what you have changed and why. Then click the Create pull request button. Please ensure you leave the Allow edits from maintainers option checked so we can provide you with feedback on your pull request. Your pull request has now been created! Please be patient while someone from the PnP PowerShell team will review your suggested changes and potentially provide you with feedback. This may take some time, as all of us are doing this in our spare time. Thanks for contributing! Troubleshooting My local fork is ahead of pnp:dev First proceed with the steps in the Cloning the repository to your local file system section to make sure you have a local copy of your version of the code. After you've set up a local copy of the code, in a command prompt or PowerShell window, navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository to and execute the following command: git fetch upstream Now execute the following command to reset your local dev branch to the upstream dev branch: git checkout dev git reset --hard upstream/dev git push origin dev --force If you now return to GitHub in your webbrowser into your own fork, it should show that your dev branch is up to date with the upstream dev branch. How do I build against a local version of PnP Core and/or PnP Framework? If your change also requires updates to PnP Core and/or PnP Framework, you need to build PnP PowerShell against your locally built version of PnP Core and/or PnP Framework. To do so, follow the steps in this article. If your changes just require updates to PnP PowerShell, you don't need to do this and can just follow the steps outlined on this page. Visual Studio Code shows a dialog mentioning Make sure you configure your \"user.name\" and \"user.email\" in git. If Visual Studio Code shows a dialog mentioning Make sure you configure your \"user.name\" and \"user.email\" in git., click Cancel in that dialog and open a PowerShell 7 window and execute the following commands, replacing the values with your information: git config --global user.name \"John Doe\" git config --global user.email \"johndoe@outlook.com\" You only need to do this once on your machine. Visual Studio shows a dialog asking to install the coreclr component If Visual Studio Code asks you to install the coreclr component, click Cancel as it won't work trying to install from that dialog. Instead go to the extensions tab on the left in Visual Studio, use the search box to search for c#, click on the result that states C# for Visual Studio Code (powered by OmniSharp) and then click Install. How do I know the process ID to attach to for debugging? If you wish to step through your code debugging it, in your PowerShell 7 window, type the following command to reveal the process ID it runs under: $PID Alternatively, if you wish the process ID to be shown in the title of the window to make it a little easier to find the process ID, in a PowerShell 7 window, type the following command: notepad $profile If it states it cannot find the file and asks you if it should create a new file, answer with Yes. In the profile file, add the following line: $Host.UI.RawUI.WindowTitle = \"[PID: $PID] : PowerShell $($PSVersionTable.PSVersion)\" Save notepad and open a new PowerShell 7 window. It should now show the process ID in the title of the window."

The way PnP PowerShell authenticates you to your tenant has changed. We now use OAuth behind the scenes to authenticate you. We support username/password auth, device code auth and app-only authentication. If you were using Connect-PnPOnline with the -Credentials you will have to register first an Azure AD application on your tenant. This is very straightforward and simple: Register-PnPManagementShellAccess This cmdlet will ask you to authenticate, and then provide consent to the PnP Management Shell application. A registration will be added to the Azure AD of your tenant. This is a one-time action per tenant. After you provided consent you will be able to authenticate using: Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://[tenant].sharepoint.com -Credentials (Get-Credential) Read more information about authentication. Changes Check your scripts. As this is a major release, we have deprecated cmdlets, renamed cmdlets, and we marked some parameters as obsolete. Important We marked the -Web parameter as obsolete on many cmdlets. The -Web parameter allows you to execute cmdlets to a subweb underneath the current web. Due to API changes under the hood of PnP Powershell we marked this parameter as obsolete. The parameter will be removed in a future release.

See https://pnp.github.io/powershell/articles/connecting.html for more information on the options to connect. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" Connect to SharePoint prompting for the username and password. When a generic credential is added to the Windows Credential Manager with https://contoso.sharepoint.com, PowerShell will not prompt for username and password and use those stored credentials instead. EXAMPLE 2 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -Credentials (Get-Credential) Connect to SharePoint prompting for the username and password to use to authenticate EXAMPLE 3 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.de\" -ClientId 344b8aab-389c-4e4a-8fa1-4c1ae2c0a60d -ClientSecret $clientSecret This will authenticate you to the site using Legacy ACS authentication EXAMPLE 4 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -DeviceLogin This will authenticate you using the PnP Management Shell Multi-Tenant application. A browser window will have to be opened where you have to enter a code that is shown in your PowerShell window. EXAMPLE 5 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -DeviceLogin -LaunchBrowser This will authenticate you using the PnP Management Shell Multi-Tenant application. A browser window will automatically open and the code you need to enter will be automatically copied to your clipboard. EXAMPLE 6 $password = (ConvertTo-SecureString -AsPlainText 'myprivatekeypassword' -Force) Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -CertificatePath 'c:\\mycertificate.pfx' -CertificatePassword $password -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' Connects using an Azure Active Directory registered application using a locally available certificate containing a private key. See https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread for a sample on how to get started. EXAMPLE 7 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' -Thumbprint 34CFAA860E5FB8C44335A38A097C1E41EEA206AA Connects to SharePoint using app-only tokens via an app's declared permission scopes. See https://github.com/SharePoint/PnP-PowerShell/tree/master/Samples/SharePoint.ConnectUsingAppPermissions for a sample on how to get started. Ensure you have imported the private key certificate, typically the .pfx file, into the Windows Certificate Store for the certificate with the provided thumbprint. EXAMPLE 8 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 -CertificateBase64Encoded $base64encodedstring -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' Connects using an Azure Active Directory registered application using a certificate with a private key that has been base64 encoded. See https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/security-apponly-azuread for a sample on how to get started. EXAMPLE 9 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -Interactive -ClientId 6c5c98c7-e05a-4a0f-bcfa-0cfc65aa1f28 Connects to the Azure AD, acquires an access token and allows PnP PowerShell to access both SharePoint and the Microsoft Graph. Notice that you will have to register your own App first, by means of Register-PnPEntraIDAdd to use this method. You will also have to provide the -ClientId parameter starting September 9, 2024. Alternatively, create an environment variable, call it \"ENTRAID_APP_ID\" and set the value to the app id you created. If you use -Interactive and this environment variable is present you will not have to use -ClientId. EXAMPLE 10 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://portal.contoso.com\" -TransformationOnPrem -CurrentCredential Connects to on-premises SharePoint 2013, 2016 or 2019 site with the current user's on-premises Windows credential (e.g. domain\\user). This option is only supported for being able to transform on-premises classic wiki, webpart, blog and publishing pages into modern pages in a SharePoint Online site. Although other PnP cmdlets might work as well, they're officially not supported for being used in an on-premises context. See http://aka.ms/sharepoint/modernization/pages for more details on page transformation. EXAMPLE 11 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ManagedIdentity Get-PnPTeamsTeam Connects using a system assigned managed identity to Microsoft Graph. Using this way of connecting only works with environments that support managed identities: Azure Functions, Azure Automation Runbooks and the Azure Cloud Shell. Read up on this article how it can be used. EXAMPLE 12 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -ManagedIdentity -UserAssignedManagedIdentityObjectId 363c1b31-6872-47fd-a616-574d3aec2a51 Get-PnPList Connects using an user assigned managed identity with object/principal ID 363c1b31-6872-47fd-a616-574d3aec2a51 to SharePoint Online. Using this way of connecting only works with environments that support managed identities: Azure Functions, Azure Automation Runbooks and the Azure Cloud Shell. Read up on this article how it can be used. EXAMPLE 13 Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://contoso.sharepoint.com\" -AccessToken $token This method assumes you have acquired a valid OAuth2 access token from Azure AD with the correct audience and permissions set. Using this method PnP PowerShell will not acquire tokens dynamically and if the token expires (typically after 1 hour) cmdlets will fail to work using this method. EXAMPLE 14 Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -EnvironmentVariable -Tenant 'contoso.onmicrosoft.com' This example uses the AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH and AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD environment variable values to authenticate. The AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variable must be present and Tenant parameter value must be provided. EXAMPLE 15 Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -EnvironmentVariable This example uses the AZURE_USERNAME and AZURE_PASSWORD environment variables as credentials to authenticate. If AZURE_CLIENT_ID is not present, then it will try to use the default PnP Management Shell Azure AD app as fallback and attempt to authenticate. This method assumes you have the necessary environment variables available. For more information about the required environment variables, please refer to this article, Azure.Identity Environment Variables here. So, when using -EnvironmentVariable method for authenticating, we will require AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH, AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD and AZURE_CLIENT_ID environment variables for using the service principal with certificate method for authentication. If AZURE_USERNAME, AZURE_PASSWORD and AZURE_CLIENT_ID, we will use these environment variables and authenticate using credentials flow. We support only Service principal with certificate and Username with password mode for authentication. Configuration will be attempted in that order. For example, if values for a certificate and username+password are both present, the client certificate method will be used. EXAMPLE 16 Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -AzureEnvironment Custom -MicrosoftGraphEndPoint \"custom.graph.microsoft.com\" -AzureADLoginEndPoint \"https://custom.login.microsoftonline.com\" Use this method to connect to a custom Azure Environment. You can also specify the MicrosoftGraphEndPoint and AzureADLoginEndPoint parameters if applicable. If specified, then these values will be used to make requests to Graph and to retrieve access token. EXAMPLE 17 Connect-PnPOnline -Url contoso.sharepoint.com -AzureADWorkloadIdentity This example uses Azure AD Workload Identity to retrieve access tokens. For more information about this, please refer to this article, Azure AD Workload Identity. We are following the guidance mentioned in this sample to retrieve the access tokens. PARAMETERS -AccessToken Using this parameter you can provide your own access token. Notice that it is recommend to use one of the other connection methods as this will limits the offered functionality on PnP PowerShell. For instance if the token expires (typically after 1 hour) will not be able to acquire a new valid token, which the other connection methods do allow. You are responsible for providing your own valid access token when using this parameter, for the correct audience, with the correct permissions scopes.

Also some of the functionality of the provisioning engine (Get-PnPSiteTemplate, Get-PnPTenantTemplate, Invoke-PnPSiteTemplate, Invoke-PnPTenantTemplate) will not work because of this reason. The cookies will in general expire within a few days and if you use -UseWebLogin within that time popup window will appear that will disappear immediately, this is expected.

The Copy-PnPItemProxy cmdlet copies an item from one location to another location in the same namespace. For instance, it can copy a file to a folder, but it can't copy a file to a certificate drive. This cmdlet doesn't cut or delete the items being copied. The particular items that the cmdlet can copy depend on the PowerShell provider that exposes the item. For instance, it can copy files and directories in a file system drive and registry keys and entries in the registry drive. This cmdlet can copy and rename items in the same command. To rename an item, enter the new name in the value of the Destination parameter. To rename an item and not copy it, use the Rename-Item cmdlet. For more information and details, please refer to the official PowerShell documentation here. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Copy-PnPItemProxy \"C:\\Users\\Admin\\seattle.master\" -Destination \"C:\\Presentation\" This example copies the seattle.master file to the C:\\Presentation directory.

SYNTAX Import-PnPTermSet -GroupName <String> -Path <String> [-TermSetId <Guid>] [-SynchronizeDeletions] [-IsOpen <Boolean>] [-Contact <String>] [-Owner <String>] [-TermStoreName <String>] [-Connection <PnPConnection>] DESCRIPTION The format of the file is the same as that used by the import function in the web interface. A sample file can be obtained from the web interface. This is a CSV file, with the following headings: Term Set Name,Term Set Description,LCID,Available for Tagging,Term Description,Level 1 Term,Level 2 Term,Level 3 Term,Level 4 Term,Level 5 Term,Level 6 Term,Level 7 Term The first data row must contain the Term Set Name, Term Set Description, and LCID, and should also contain the first term. It is recommended that a fixed GUID be used as the termSetId, to allow the term set to be easily updated (so do not pass Guid.Empty). In contrast to the web interface import, this is not a one-off import but runs synchronization logic allowing updating of an existing Term Set. When synchronizing, any existing terms are matched (with Term Description and Available for Tagging updated as necessary), any new terms are added in the correct place in the hierarchy, and (if synchronizeDeletions is set) any terms not in the imported file are removed. The import file also supports an expanded syntax for the Term Set Name and term names (Level 1 Term, Level 2 Term, etc). These columns support values with the format 'Name | GUID', with the name and GUID separated by a pipe character (note that the pipe character is invalid to use within a taxonomy item name). This expanded syntax is not required, but can be used to ensure all terms have fixed IDs. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Import-PnPTermSet -GroupName 'Standard Terms' -Path 'C:\\\\Temp\\\\ImportTermSet.csv' -SynchronizeDeletions Creates (or updates) the term set specified in the import file, in the group specified, removing any existing terms not in the file.

When providing a site design name and multiple site designs exist with the same name, all of them will be invoked and applied. It is also possible to provide a site script directly without having to add it as a site script first. This could be ideal for making quick one time copies of i.e. lists and sites. When passing in a site script through -Script, you only need to have permissions to the site you are applying the site script to. When passing in a site script through -Identity, you need to be connected to the SharePoint Online admin site collection and have rights to access it. Using the -WebUrl you can specify the full URL of the site collection you wish to apply the site script to. The output provided by this cmdlet are the site script actions that have been applied along with for each of them information on if they were successfully applied.

    "keywords": "Invoke-PnPSiteSwap SYNOPSIS Invokes a job to swap the location of a site with another site while archiving the original site. SYNTAX Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl <string> -TargetUrl <string> -ArchiveUrl <string> [-DisableRedirection] [-NoWait] [-Verbose] [-Connection <PnPConnection>] DESCRIPTION Swaps the location of a source site with a target site while archiving the original target site. Please note, the target site must be either: The root site, for example https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com; or The search center site, for example https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/search. When the swap is initiated, the target site is moved to the archive location and the source site is moved to the target location. By default, a site redirect is created at the source location that will redirect traffic to the target location. If the target is the root site at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com, then the following preparation activities should be performed prior to performing the swap: Any Featured links defined in SharePoint Start Page at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx will not be displayed after performing the swap. If required, the Featured links should be documented so they can be manually recreated after the swap. Functionality such as external sharing and application interfaces are dependent on the policies and permissions defined at the root site. Review the source site to ensure that it has the required policies and permissions as per the existing root site. This includes external sharing settings as well as site permissions. Larger tenants that have more than ~10,000 licenses may also need to run the Page Diagnostic Tool against the source site. Any analysis results that have the category Attention required (Red) or Improvement opportunities (Orange) will need to be remediated before performing the swap. The source and target sites can't be connected to an Office 365 group. They also can't be hub sites or associated with a hub. If a site is a hub site, unregister it as a hub site, swap the root site, and then register the site as a hub site. If a site is associated with a hub, disassociate the site, swap the root site, and then re-associate the site. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite -TargetUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com -ArchiveUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive Archives the existing site at https://contoso.sharepoint.com to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive and moves https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite to https://contoso.sharepoint.com. A site redirect will be created at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite that will redirect any requests to https://contoso.sharepoint.com. EXAMPLE 2 Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SearchSite -TargetUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search -ArchiveUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive Archives the existing Search Center site at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive and moves the https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SearchSite to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search. A site redirect be created at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SearchSite that will redirect any requests to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search. EXAMPLE 3 Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite -TargetUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com -ArchiveUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive -DisableRedirection Archives the existing site at https://contoso.sharepoint.com to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive and moves https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite to https://contoso.sharepoint.com. A site redirect will not be created at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite. PARAMETERS -SourceUrl URL of the source site. The site at this location must exist before performing the swap. If the target is the root site at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com then the source site must be either a Modern Team Site (STS#3) or a Communication Site (SITEPAGEPUBLISHING#0). If the target is the search center site at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/search then the source site must be either a Search Center Site (SRCHCEN#0) or a Basic Search Center Site (SRCHCENTERLITE#0).

    "keywords": "Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory SYNOPSIS Required Permissions SharePoint: Sites.FullControl.All, TermStore.ReadWrite.All, User.ReadWrite.All Microsoft Graph: User.Read ACS: No longer needed Synchronizes user profiles from Entra ID into the SharePoint Online User Profiles SYNTAX Upload file Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping <Hashtable> [-IdType <Enum>] [-Users <Array>] [-Folder <String>] [-Wait] [-Verbose] [-Connection <PnPConnection>] DESCRIPTION This cmdlet allows synchronizing user profiles from Entra ID to their SharePoint Online User Profile equivalents. Note that certain properties are already synced by default. A list of these can be found here: https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/user-profile-sync#properties-that-are-synced-into-sharepoint-user-profiles For other properties not listed on this page, you can use this cmdlet to synchronize them. You can provide the property name(s) in Entra ID and specify its equivalent property in SharePoint Online for the values to be mapped to. Note that SharePoint Online User Profile properties you wish to sync to must have the checkbox unchecked for \"Allow users to edit values for this property\" in the user profile property in the SharePoint User Profile service application. It also must have \"User can override\" checked under Policy Settings of the user profile property in the SharePoint User Profile service application. When running this cmdlet, it will upload a file named userprofilesyncdata-<timestamp>-<guid>.json to the document library of the SharePoint Online site you are connected to. From there an asynchronous process will be started that processes the JSON file and updates the user profiles on the SharePoint Online side. The time before this process starts varies. Once that process is done and only if something failed, you will find a new folder created in the same document library of which the folder name starts with the same name as the filename. It will contain a .log file in which you can find the results of it trying to update the user profiles in SharePoint Online which were specified in the JSON file. If all the user profile properties have been updated successfully, it will not create such a folder and log file. You can also query the import job status using Get-PnPUPABulkImportStatus -JobId <jobid>. The jobid will be returned upon running this cmdlet and can be fed into this cmdlet to get the actual status. It will show State: Submitted after running this cmdlet and before processing it and State: Succeeded once its done and was successful or State: Error if it failed. It will also return full details on the file it will use to update the user profiles and the location of the log file once its done processing and only if it failed. For documentation on all the possible states it can be in, see https://learn.microsoft.com/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/bulk-user-profile-update-api-for-sharepoint-online#parameters-2. When not providing -Users, it will fetch all the users and the properties defined in the mapping from Entra ID itself. You can also opt to query for a subset of Entra ID users to update using i.e. Get-PnPAzureAdUser and feed the outcome of that to the -Users parameter. In this case you must ensure that the user objects you supply contain the properties you wish to sync towards SharePoint Online. When not providing -Folder, it will assume a document library named \"Shared Documents\" is present within the site collection you're currently connected to. In case you are not using an English site collection, this name may be different and localized. In that case use the -Folder parameter passing in the localized name of the document library you wish to upload the mapping file to. Required Permissions It is no longer needed to use ACS permissions for this cmdlet to work. The following permissions, granted through an Entra ID application registration, should suffice. It can also be used using a Managed Identity within Azure using the same permissions. SharePoint: Sites.FullControl.All, TermStore.ReadWrite.All, User.ReadWrite.All Microsoft Graph: User.Read EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping @{\"HomePhone\"=\"phone\";\"CustomProperty\"=\"DisplayName\"} This will retrieve all users in Entra ID and take its phone property to update in the HomePhone field in the SharePoint Online user profiles for each of these users. Similarly it will set the SharePoint Online User Profile property named CustomProperty to the value of the DisplayName as set in Entra ID on the user object. It will upload the JSON file with the instructions for the update to the 'Shared Documents' library of the site currently connected to. EXAMPLE 2 $users = Get-PnPAzureADUser -Filter \"jobTitle eq 'IT Administrator'\" Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping @{\"CostCenter\"=\"extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter\"} -Users $users This will update the CostCenter SharePoint Online User Profile property with the value of the property extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter coming from Entra ID for the users getting returned by the Get-PnPAzureADUser query. It will upload the JSON file with the instructions for the update to the 'Shared Documents' library of the site currently connected to. EXAMPLE 3 $delta = Get-PnPAzureADUser -Delta -DeltaToken $delta.DeltaToken Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping @{\"CostCenter\"=\"extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter\"} -Users $delta.Users This will retrieve all the users from Entra ID and includes a DeltaToken in the response. Using the DeltaToken you can retrieve only those users which have had changes done to their attributes since the DeltaToken was given out. This makes it ideal to use with the profile sync as this way you only will sync those users that have had changes to their profiles. Only for those users this will update the CostCenter SharePoint Online User Profile property with the value of the property extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter coming from Entra ID. It will upload the JSON file with the instructions for the update to the 'Shared Documents' library of the site currently connected to. EXAMPLE 4 Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping @{\"CostCenter\"=\"extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter\"} -Folder \"User Profile Sync\" This will retrieve all users in Entra ID and take its extension property named CostCenter to update in the CostCenter field in the SharePoint Online user profiles for each of these users. It will upload the JSON file with the instructions for the update to a library named 'User Profile Sync' in the site currently connected to. EXAMPLE 5 Sync-PnPSharePointUserProfilesFromAzureActiveDirectory -UserProfilePropertyMapping @{\"CostCenter\"=\"extension_b0b5aaa58a0a4287acd826c5b8330e48_CostCenter\"} -Folder \"User Profile Sync\\Jobs\" -Wait -Verbose This will retrieve all users in Entra ID and take its extension property named CostCenter to update in the CostCenter field in the SharePoint Online user profiles for each of these users. It will upload the JSON file with the instructions for the update to the folder Jobs inside a library named 'User Profile Sync' in the site currently connected to. It will wait with continuing the execution of the remainder of your script until the synchronization process has either completed or failed. It will output verbose logging to provide input on its status while executing. Notice that it may very well take 10 minutes or more for the synchronization to complete.

    "keywords": "PnP PowerShell PnP PowerShell is a cross-platform PowerShell Module providing over 700 cmdlets that work with Microsoft 365 environments and products such as SharePoint Online, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Planner, Microsoft Flow and more. It runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Getting up and running Follow the installation steps to get up and running in minutes. See the articles section for more information on authentication and configuration. All cmdlets have been documented too. See Using PnP PowerShell in Docker containers article for information how to run PnP.PowerShell without installing it. I've found a bug, where do I need to log an issue or create a PR You can create an issue at https://github.com/pnp/powershell/issues, but please consider first if asking a question at https://github.com/pnp/powershell/discussions is more appropriate. We would like to focus the issues on actual bugs whereas PnP PowerShell related questions can be asked in the discussions section. As some of the code being PnP PowerShell is actually coming from other PnP repositories, we can move your issue over to that specific repository. You will be notified by email about that. Before you start to work on code change consider starting a discussion in the repository first. It could potentially save you a lot of time if someone is about to submit a change with exactly the same functionality. It will also allow you to discuss a possible change with the maintainers of the repository before you start to work on it. Contributing to PnP PowerShell Follow the getting started contributing guidelines to help out. Sharing is caring! Supportability and SLA This library is open-source and community provided library with active community providing support for it. This is not Microsoft provided module so there's no SLA or direct support for this open-source component from Microsoft. Please report any issues using the issues list. This project has adopted the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct. For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments."
