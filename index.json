    "keywords": "Authentication Setting up Access PnP PowerShell allows you to authenticate with credentials to your tenant. However, due to changes in the underlying SDKs we require you first to register a Azure AD Application which will allow you to authenticate. The easiest way to do this by using a built-in cmdlet: Register-PnPManagementShellAccess You'll notice that the cmdlet is not called Register-PnPPowerShellAccess . This is because both PnP PowerShell and the CLI for Microsoft 365 make use of this Azure AD application. Important You need to run this cmdlet with an identity that has write access to the Azure AD. You are not creating a new application in the sense of something that runs in your Azure AD tenant. You're only adding a registration to your Azure AD, a so called 'consent' for people in your tenant to use that application. The access rights the application requires are delegate only, so you will always have to provide credentials or another way of identifying the user actually using that application. During execution of the cmdlet you will be talked through the consent flow. This means that a browser window will open, you will be asked to authenticate, and you will be asked to consent to a number of permissions. After this permissions has been granted a new entry will show up if you navigate to Enterprise Applications in your Azure AD. If you want to revoke the consent you can simply remove the entry from the Enterprise Applications. Setting up access to your own Azure AD App PnP PowerShell has a cmdlet that allows you to register a new Azure AD App, and optionally generate the certificates for you to use to login with that app. Register-PnPAzureADApp -ApplicationName PnPRocks -Tenant mytenant.onmicrosoft.com -OutPath c:\\mycertificates -DeviceLogin When you run the cmdlet above you will be asked to navigate to the shown url and enter the code shown. After that a new app will be registerd in the Azure AD (make sure you have the rights to do this), and a certificate will be generated and uploaded to that app. After this a URL will be shown which you have to navigate to to provide consent for this application. By default a limited set of permissions scopes is added, but you can provide the -Scopes parameter to provide your own permission scopes. The cmdlet will save both the CER and PFX files to the specified location with the -Outpath parameter. The names of the files will be matching the -ApplicationName parameter, e.g. in the example above the files will be called PnPRocks.cer and PnPRocks.pfx. The output of the cmdlet will show the clientid. After all is set up and consent has been provided you can login using: Connect-PnPOnline -Url \"https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com\" -ClientId [clientid] -Tenant [yourtenant.onmicrosoft.com] -CertificatePath certificate.pfx Authenticating with Credentials Enter Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com -Credentials (Get-Credential) and you will be prompted for credentials. Authenticating with pre-stored credentials using the Windows Credential Manager (Windows only) Add-PnPStoredCredential -Name \"yourlabel\" -Username youruser@domain.com You will be prompted to provide a password. After that you can login using: Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com -Credentials \"yourlabel\" Authenticating with pre-stored credentials using the Secrets Management Module from Microsoft (Multi-Platform) Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretManagement -AllowPrerelease Install-Module -Name Microsoft.PowerShell.SecretStore -AllowPrerelease Set-SecretStoreConfiguration Set-Secret -Name \"yourlabel\" -Secret (Get-Credential) This creates a new secret vault on your computer. You will be asked to provide a password to access the vault. If you access the vault you will be prompted for that password. In case you want to want to write automated scripts you will have to turn off this password prompt as follows: Set-SecretStoreConfiguration -Authentication None For more information about these cmdlets, check out the github repositories: https://github.com/powershell/secretmanagement and https://github.com/powershell/secretstore . After you set up the vault and you added a credential Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com -Credentials (Get-Secret -Name \"yourlabel\")"

    "keywords": "Using PnP PowerShell in Azure Functions In this article we will setup an Azure Function to use PnP PowerShell Create the function app As the UI in https://portal.azure.com changes every now and then, but the principles stay the same, follow the following steps: Create a new Function App and navigate there when ready. Make sure you select the option to run PowerShell V3 functions, based upon PowerShell 7. Make PnP PowerShell available to all functions in the app Navigate to App files which is located the left side menu of the function app under the Functions header. In the dropdown presented, select requirements.psd1 . You'll notice that the function app wants to provide the Azure cmdlets. If you do not need those, consider removing the Az entry presented. Add a new entry or replace the whole contents of the file with: @{ 'PnP.PowerShell' = '0.3.9-nightly' } The version that will be installed will be the specified nightly build. The moment we release a full 1.0 release you can use wildcards too: @{ 'PnP.PowerShell' = '1.*' } This will then automatically download any minor version of the major 1 release when available. Notice that you cannot use wildcards to specify a nightly build. If you decide to remove the Az cmdlets, save the requirements.psd1 file and edit the profile.psd file. Mark out the following block in the file as follows: # if ($env:MSI_SECRET) { # Disable-AzContextAutosave -Scope Process | Out-Null # Connect-AzAccount -Identity # } Save the file. Create your credentials Navigate to Configuration under Settings and create a new Application Setting. Enter tenant_user and enter the username you want to authenticate with as the user Enter tenant_pwd and enter the password you want to use for that user Create the function Create a new function and replace the function code with following example: using namespace System.Net # Input bindings are passed in via param block. param($Request, $TriggerMetadata) # Write to the Azure Functions log stream. Write-Host \"PowerShell HTTP trigger function processed a request.\" $securePassword = ConvertTo-SecureString $env:tenant_pwd -AsPlainText -Force $credentials = New-Object PSCredential ($env:tenant_user, $securePassword) Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/demo -Credentials $credentials $web = Get-PnPWeb; $body = \"The title of the web is $($web.Title)\" # Associate values to output bindings by calling 'Push-OutputBinding'. Push-OutputBinding -Name Response -Value ([HttpResponseContext]@{ StatusCode = [HttpStatusCode]::OK Body = $body }) In the example above we are retrieving the username and password from the settings as environment variables. We then create a new credentials object which we pass in to the Connect-PnPOnline cmdlet. After connecting to SharePoint we output the title of the web through the function."

This will restore all references and copy the required files to the correct location on your computer. Notice that we refer to the nuget package of the PnP.Framework project. As this is rebuilt every night you will receive a new version of the PnP.Framework package every day. If you run on Windows both the .NET Framework and the .NET Core version will be build and installed. If you run on MacOS or Linux only the .NET Core version will be build and installed. Note Unlike the older repository for the legacy version of PowerShell for Windows you do not need to have local clone of the PnP Framework repository anymore (we changed the PnP Sites Core library used under the hood to the PnP Framework repository, see for more info about that library here: https://github.com/pnp/pnpframework ). Folder Structure In the repository you'll find the following folder structure - build - documentation - pages - resources - samples - src/ALC /Commands /Resources /Tests Build folder The build folder contains scripts used to build the project, build the Helpfile, etc. While debugging locally the Build-Debug.ps1 script is the script to use to build the project and copy the correct files to the correct location on your machine. The other build scripts are used in GitHub actions to automate the nightly builds etc. Documentation folder The documentation folder contains the markdown files all describing every single cmdlet available. If you create a new cmdlet we require you to also provide a documentation file. Notice that the documentation files require a front-matters yaml header as specified in the other files. Updated accordingly. Pages folder The pages folder contains the structure which is published to https://pnp.github.io/powershell . We automatically copy the cmdlet documentation in there at build time, but you can create PRs on the 'articles' folder if you want. Resources The resources folder contains an XML file which is copied into the output folder of the build. This file defines how PowerShell should parse and render the objects shown as output from the PnP PowerShell cmdlets src/ALC Due to possible conflicts with already loaded assemblies in PowerShell we create an Assembly Load Context for a specific assembly. See https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/dependency-loading/understanding-assemblyloadcontext for more information about ALCs. src/Commands This is the main location of all the cmdlet code. src/Resources Any resources used by cmdlets go into this folder src/Tests This is where the the unit/integration tests reside. See Running test for more information. Running against a local copy of the PnP Framework If your code changes require changes to the PnP Framework you might want to use a local version of the PnP Framework which you modified. In order to do this you will need to have both the PnP.PowerShell repository ( https://github.com/pnp/powershell ) and the PnP.Framework repository ( https://github.com/pnp/pnpframework ) locally on your computer. Make sure that both repositories are located at the same folder level. E.g.: c:\\repos\\powershell c:\\repos\\pnpframework Now, build the PnP Framework by navigating to the build folder in the pnpframework folder and run Build-Debug.ps1 . This will compile the PnP Framework. Next, navigate to the build folder of the powershell folder and run Build-Debug.ps1 -LocalPnPFramework . This will compile PnP PowerShell and refer to the -locally- compiled version of the PnP Framework. If you do not specify the -LocalPnPFramework switch it will refer to the latest nightly build available on NuGet.org instead."

Notice that a URL alike https://yourtenant.sharepoint.com/sites/demo will also match the secret. You can create multiple secrets too. PnP PowerShell will then try to match the most complete label first, e.g. a secret ending on /sites/demo1 will proceed the one without that ending.

    "keywords": "Invoke-PnPSiteSwap SYNOPSIS Invokes a job to swap the location of a site with another site while archiving the original site. SYNTAX Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl <string> -TargetUrl <string> -ArchiveUrl <string> [-DisableRedirection] [-NoWait] DESCRIPTION Swaps the location of a source site with a target site while archiving the original target site. Please note, the target site must be either: The root site, for example https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com; or The search center site, for example https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/search . When the swap is initiated, the target site is moved to the archive location and the source site is moved to the target location. By default, a site redirect is created at the source location that will redirect traffic to the target location. If the target is the root site at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com , then the following preparation activities should be performed prior to performing the swap: Any Featured links defined in SharePoint Start Page at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/_layouts/15/sharepoint.aspx will not be displayed after performing the swap. If required, the Featured links should be documented so they can be manually recreated after the swap. Functionality such as external sharing and application interfaces are dependent on the policies and permissions defined at the root site. Review the source site to ensure that it has the required policies and permissions as per the existing root site. This includes external sharing settings as well as site permissions. Larger tenants that have more than ~10,000 licenses may also need to run the Page Diagnostic Tool against the source site. Any analysis results that have the category Attention required (Red) or Improvement opprtunities (Orange) will need to be remediated before performing the swap. The source and target sites can't be connected to an Office 365 group. They also can't be hub sites or associated with a hub. If a site is a hub site, unregister it as a hub site, swap the root site, and then register the site as a hub site. If a site is associated with a hub, disassociate the site, swap the root site, and then reassociate the site. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite -TargetUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com -ArchiveUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive Archives the existing site at https://contoso.sharepoint.com to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive and moves https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite to https://contoso.sharepoint.com . A site redirect will be created at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite that will redirect any requests to https://contoso.sharepoint.com . EXAMPLE 2 Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SearchSite -TargetUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search -ArchiveUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive Archives the existing Search Center site at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive and moves the https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SearchSite to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search . A site redirect be created at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/SearchSite that will redirect any requests to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/search . EXAMPLE 3 Invoke-PnPSiteSwap -SourceUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite -TargetUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com -ArchiveUrl https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive -DisableRedirection Archives the existing site at https://contoso.sharepoint.com to https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/Archive and moves https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite to https://contoso.sharepoint.com . A site redirect will not be created at https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/CommunicationSite . PARAMETERS -SourceUrl URL of the source site. The site at this location must exist before performing the swap. If the target is the root site at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com then the source site must be either a Modern Team Site (STS#3) or a Communication Site (SITEPAGEPUBLISHING#0). If the target is the search center site at https://tenant-name.sharepoint.com/search then the source site must be either a Search Center Site (SRCHCEN#0) or a Basic Search Center Site (SRCHCENTERLITE#0). Type: String Parameter Sets: (All) Required: True Position: Named Default value: None Accept pipeline input: False Accept wildcard characters: False -TargetUrl URL of the target site that the source site will be swapped to. The site at this location must exist before performing the swap.

See https://github.com/pnp/PnP-PowerShell/wiki/Connect-options for more information on the options to connect and the APIs you can access with them. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com Connect to SharePoint prompting for the username and password. When a generic credential is added to the Windows Credential Manager with https://contoso.sharepoint.com , PowerShell will not prompt for username and password and use those stored credentials instead. EXAMPLE 2 Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com -Credentials (Get-Credential) Connect to SharePoint prompting for the username and password to use to authenticate EXAMPLE 3 Connect-PnPOnline -Url http://yourlocalserver -CurrentCredentials Connect to SharePoint using the credentials of the current user logged in to the machine EXAMPLE 4 Connect-PnPOnline -Url http://yourlocalserver -Credentials 'O365Creds' Connect to SharePoint using credentials from the Windows Credential Manager, as defined by the label 'O365Creds' EXAMPLE 5 Connect-PnPOnline -Url http://yourlocalserver -Credentials (Get-Credential) -UseAdfs Connect to SharePoint through ADFS prompting for the username and password to authenticate with EXAMPLE 6 Connect-PnPOnline -Url http://yourlocalserver -UseAdfsCert Connect to SharePoint through ADFS using client certificate allowing you to select the client certificate to use for authentication EXAMPLE 7 Connect-PnPOnline -Url http://yourlocalserver -UseAdfsCert -ClientCertificate (Get-ChildItem -Path Cert:\\CurrentUser\\My\\3A16F907D2BFFF1C22F447E55429C16F8BD3AC6E) Connect to SharePoint through ADFS using the client certificate with thumbprint 3A16F907D2BFFF1C22F447E55429C16F8BD3AC6E from the local machine certificate store for the current user EXAMPLE 8 Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://yourserver -Credentials (Get-Credential) -CreateDrive cd SPO:\\\\ dir This will prompt you for credentials and creates a context for the other PowerShell commands to use. It will also create a SPO:\\ drive you can use to navigate around the site EXAMPLE 9 Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://yourserver -Credentials (Get-Credential) -AuthenticationMode FormsAuthentication This will prompt you for credentials and creates a context for the other PowerShell commands to use. It assumes your server is configured for Forms Based Authentication (FBA) EXAMPLE 10 Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.de -ClientId 344b8aab-389c-4e4a-8fa1-4c1ae2c0a60d -ClientSecret a3f3faf33f3awf3a3sfs3f3ss3f4f4a3fawfas3ffsrrffssfd -AzureEnvironment Germany This will authenticate you to the German Azure environment using the German Azure endpoints for authentication EXAMPLE 11 Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com -SPOManagementShell This will authenticate you using the SharePoint Online Management Shell application EXAMPLE 12 Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com -PnPManagementShell This will authenticate you using the PnP O365 Management Shell Multi-Tenant application. A browser window will have to be opened where you have to enter a code that is shown in your PowerShell window. EXAMPLE 13 Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com -PnPManagementShell -LaunchBrowser This will authenticate you using the PnP O365 Management Shell Multi-Tenant application. A browser window will automatically open and the code you need to enter will be automatically copied to your clipboard. EXAMPLE 14 Connect-PnPOnline -Url https://contoso.sharepoint.com -AccessToken $myaccesstoken Connects using the provided access token EXAMPLE 15 Connect-PnPOnline -Scopes \"Mail.Read\",\"Files.Read\",\"ActivityFeed.Read\" Connects to Azure Active Directory interactively and gets an OAuth 2.0 Access Token to consume the resources of the declared permission scopes. It will utilize the Azure Active Directory enterprise application named PnP Management Shell with application id 31359c7f-bd7e-475c-86db-fdb8c937548e registered by the PnP team. If you want to connect using your own Azure Active Directory application registration, use one of the Connect-PnPOnline cmdlets using a -ClientId attribute instead and pre-assign the required permissions/scopes/roles in your application registration in Azure Active Directory. The available permission scopes for Microsoft Graph are defined at the following URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference . If the requested scope(s) have been used with this connect cmdlet before, they will not be asked for consent again. You can request scopes from different APIs in one Connect, i.e. from Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft Office Management API. It will ask you to authenticate for each of the APIs you have listed scopes for. EXAMPLE 16 Connect-PnPOnline -Scopes \"Mail.Read\",\"Files.Read\",\"ActivityFeed.Read\" -Credentials (New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential (\"johndoe@contoso.onmicrosoft.com\", (ConvertTo-SecureString \"password\" -AsPlainText -Force))) Connects to Azure Active Directory using delegated permissions and gets an OAuth 2.0 Access Token to consume the resources of the declared permission scopes. It will utilize the Azure Active Directory enterprise application named PnP Management Shell with application id 31359c7f-bd7e-475c-86db-fdb8c937548e registered by the PnP team. If you want to connect using your own Azure Active Directory application registration, use one of the Connect-PnPOnline cmdlets using a -ClientId attribute instead and pre-assign the required permissions/scopes/roles in your application registration in Azure Active Directory. The available permission scopes for Microsoft Graph are defined at the following URL: https://docs.microsoft.com/graph/permissions-reference . If the requested scope(s) have been used with this connect cmdlet before, they will not be asked for consent again. You can request scopes from different APIs in one Connect, i.e. from Microsoft Graph and the Microsoft Office Management API. You must have logged on interactively with the same scopes at least once without using -Credentials to allow for the permission grant dialog to show and allow constent for the user account you would like to use. You can provide this consent by logging in once with Connect-PnPOnline -Url -PnPManagementShell -LaunchBrowser, and provide consent. This is a one-time action. From that moment on you will be able to use the cmdlet as stated here.

    "keywords": "Import-PnPTermSet SYNOPSIS Imports a taxonomy term set from a file in the standard format. SYNTAX Import-PnPTermSet -GroupName <String> -Path <String> [-TermSetId <Guid>] [-SynchronizeDeletions] [-IsOpen <Boolean>] [-Contact <String>] [-Owner <String>] [-TermStoreName <String>] [-Connection <PnPConnection>] [<CommonParameters>] DESCRIPTION The format of the file is the same as that used by the import function in the web interface. A sample file can be obtained from the web interface. This is a CSV file, with the following headings: Term Set Name,Term Set Description,LCID,Available for Tagging,Term Description,Level 1 Term,Level 2 Term,Level 3 Term,Level 4 Term,Level 5 Term,Level 6 Term,Level 7 Term The first data row must contain the Term Set Name, Term Set Description, and LCID, and should also contain the first term. It is recommended that a fixed GUID be used as the termSetId, to allow the term set to be easily updated (so do not pass Guid.Empty). In contrast to the web interface import, this is not a one-off import but runs synchronization logic allowing updating of an existing Term Set. When synchronizing, any existing terms are matched (with Term Description and Available for Tagging updated as necessary), any new terms are added in the correct place in the hierarchy, and (if synchronizeDeletions is set) any terms not in the imported file are removed. The import file also supports an expanded syntax for the Term Set Name and term names (Level 1 Term, Level 2 Term, etc). These columns support values with the format 'Name | GUID', with the name and GUID separated by a pipe character (note that the pipe character is invalid to use within a taxonomy item name). This expanded syntax is not required, but can be used to ensure all terms have fixed IDs. EXAMPLES EXAMPLE 1 Import-PnPTermSet -GroupName 'Standard Terms' -Path 'C:\\\\Temp\\\\ImportTermSet.csv' -SynchronizeDeletions Creates (or updates) the term set specified in the import file, in the group specified, removing any existing terms not in the file. EXAMPLE 2 Import-PnPTermSet -TermStoreName 'My Term Store' -GroupName 'Standard Terms' -Path 'C:\\\\Temp\\\\ImportTermSet.csv' -TermSetId '{15A98DB6-D8E2-43E6-8771-066C1EC2B8D8}' Creates (or updates) the term set specified in the import file, in the term store and group specified, using the specified ID. EXAMPLE 3 Import-PnPTermSet -GroupName 'Standard Terms' -Path 'C:\\\\Temp\\\\ImportTermSet.csv' -IsOpen $true -Contact 'user@example.org' -Owner 'user@example.org' Creates (or updates) the term set specified in the import file, setting the IsOpen, Contact, and Owner properties as specified.

    "keywords": "PnP PowerShell PnP PowerShell is a cross-platform PowerShell Module providing over 500 cmdlets that work with Microsoft 365 environments and more specifically SharePoint Online and Microsoft Teams. This module is a successor of the PnP-PowerShell module. The original cmdlets only work on Windows and Windows PowerShell and supports SharePoint On-Premises (2013, 2016 and 2019) and SharePoint Online. This version of the cmdlets is cross-platform (e.g. it works on Windows, MacOS and Linux) however will only support SharePoint Online. Going forward will only be actively maintaining the cross-platform PnP PowerShell and once we declare this module as GA we will retire and archive the PnP-PowerShell library. PnP PowerShell roadmap status We have shipped the version now both PnP PowerShell for classic PowerShell and PnP PowerShell for PowerShell 7 I've found a bug, where do I need to log an issue or create a PR Between now and the end of 2020 both PnP-PowerShell and PnP.PowerShell are actively maintained. Once the new PnP PowerShell GA's we will stop mainting the old repository. Given that the cross-platform PnP PowerShell is our future going forward we would prefer issues and PRs being created in the new https://github.com/pnp/powershell repository. If you want your PR to apply to both then it is recommend to create the PR in both repositories for the time being. Building the source code Make a clone of the repository, navigate to the build folder in the repository and run Build-Debug.ps1. See more details here . Updating the documentation All cmdlet documentation has been moved to the https://github.com/pnp/powershell/tree/dev/documentation folder. If you want to make changes, make sure to follow the format as used in the other files present there. These files follow a specific schema which allows us to generate the correct files. You can also make changes directly to the documention at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/sharepoint/sharepoint-pnp/sharepoint-pnp-cmdlets?view=sharepoint-ps . Notice that the documentation there is currently NOT reflecting this library: the documentation applies to the Windows Only version of PnP PowerShell. This project has adopted the Microsoft Open Source Code of Conduct . For more information see the Code of Conduct FAQ or contact opencode@microsoft.com with any additional questions or comments."
